        Operating System Distributor License for Java version 1.1

SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. ("SUN") IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE JAVA PLATFORM
STANDARD EDITION DEVELOPER KIT ("JDK" - THE "SOFTWARE") TO YOU ONLY
UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS
LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT"). PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT
CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING, USING, OR DISTRIBUTING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU
ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT.

1.  DEFINITIONS. "Software" means the code identified above in binary
    form, any other machine readable materials including, but not
    limited to, libraries, source files, header files, and data files),
    any updates or error corrections provided by Sun, and any user
    manuals, programming guides and other documentation provided to you
    by Sun under this Agreement, and any subsequent versions that Sun
    makes available to you hereunder.  "Operating System" means any
    version of the Linux or OpenSolaris operating systems that manages
    the hardware resources of a general purpose desktop or server
    computer and shares these resources with various software programs
    that run on top of it. "Programs" means Java technology applets and
    applications intended to run on the Java Platform Standard Edition
    (Java SE platform) platform on Java-enabled general purpose desktop
    computers and servers.

2.  License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, as well as the restrictions and exceptions set forth in
    the Software README file, Sun grants you a non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, royalty-free limited license to reproduce and use
    the Software internally, complete and unmodified, for the sole
    purposes of running Programs and designing, developing and testing
    Programs.  Sun also grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    royalty-free limited license to reproduce and distribute the
    Software, directly or indirectly through your licensees,
    distributors, resellers, or OEMs, electronically or in physical
    form or pre-installed with your Operating System on a general
    purpose desktop computer or server, provided that: (a) the Software
    and any proprietary legends or notices are complete and unmodified;
    (b) the Software is distributed with your Operating System, and
    such distribution is solely for the purposes of running Programs

    incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any
    third party that arises or results from (i) the use or distribution
    of your Operating System, or any part thereof, in any manner, or
    (ii) your use or distribution of the Software in violation of the
    terms of this Agreement or applicable law.  You shall not be
    obligated under Section 2(f)(i) if such claim would not have
    occurred but for a modification made to your Operating System by
    someone not under your direction or control, and you were in
    compliance with all other terms of this Agreement.  If the Software
    README file permits certain files to be replaced or omitted from
    your distribution, then any such replacement(s) or omission(s)
    shall not be considered a breach of Section 2(a).

     FAQ for the Operating System Distributor License for Java (DLJ)

The purpose of this FAQ is to provide some insight into Sun's thoughts
in creating the Operating System Distributor License for Java. 
Although the FAQ is not a legal document, it is designed to illustrate 
the license terms through explanation and examples. This is a well
accepted way of helping non-lawyers attain some comfort with legal
language, which is crafted by attorneys to meet the arcane 
requirements of statutes and judicial opinions. For example, 
Creative Commons does a similar thing with its "Deeds," 
(e.g. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ ) which are 
human-readable summaries of the "Legal Code" 
(e.g. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/legalcode ) and
and are accompanied by a legal disclaimer
( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/disclaimer-popup?lang=en-us ).

If you think our FAQ is contradicted by the language in the license,
we'd like to hear from you so that we can consider revising the
license to clear up any confusion. Otherwise, we encourage you to
think of the FAQ as a series of guideposts designed to help you
understand and work with the license terms. Of course, if Sun clearly
says in an FAQ that it's okay to do something (and we haven't made a
blatant typographical error), we're not going to sue you -- even if
one could make a clever legal argument that the license doesn't permit
it. We believe in simplicity and transparency, and pledge to work
diligently with the community to achieve those objectives.

Sun expects to periodically update this FAQ to better reflect the
concerns and questions of the developer community. You will find a
pointer to the latest version of this FAQ at:
  https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/developer.html 

1.  What is the Operating System Distribution License for Java
    (a.k.a. the "Distro License for Java" or DLJ)?

    The DLJ is a license created specifically for individuals and
    communities who want to distribute Sun's binary Java Development
    Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with a Linux or
    OpenSolaris Operating System (OS) distribution.

2.   Why is Sun releasing the DLJ?

    It's been difficult for developers who want to use Java SE
    technology on a broad choice of Linux or OpenSolaris distributions
    to easily obtain and use Sun's JDK or JRE. One issue has been the
    redistribution terms of the Binary Code License (BCL) for Java SE
    technology, which was never intended to license these bits for
    general distribution with an Operating System. With this new
    license, Sun is enabling the developer community to distribute our
    binary JDK and JRE with distributions of Linux or OpenSolaris
    operating systems, while still maintaining compatibility with the
    Java Specifications.

3.  How do I become a "DLJ Licensee?"

    The DLJ is distributed by Sun as a "click-through license" in
    special bundles available on java.net in the jdk-distros project
    at https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net . These bundles contain the
    same JDK software found in the standard Linux distribution bundles
    and the Solaris bundles in the download area on java.sun.com
    except that the LICENSE and README file are replaced by the DLJ
    and a modified README file with matching terms. The README file
    included in these bundles allows you to create JRE distributions
    from the JDK bundles by following instructions in the file.

4.  What does the DLJ allow me to do?

    You can: 
    - Use the JDK on your OS to design, develop, test, and run Java programs. 
    - Repackage the JDK for use with your OS, within the limitations
      spelled out in the README file.
    - Distribute the JDK on any media, online, and preinstalled on
      systems as a package with your OS.
    - Distribute the JDK directly, or indirectly through your
      licensees, distributors, resellers, OEMs, or downstream
      recipients of your OS.

5.  When I exercise the license and distribute the JDK, does it become
    part of my Operating System, or do I need to explicitly declare it
    as part of my OS?

    No - the license grants you the right to distribute the JDK with
    your Operating System, but it is still a separate piece of
    software. You do not need to make the JDK part of what you define
    as your OS when you exercise the license. All you need to do to
    exercise the license is distribute the JDK with your OS. For
    example, you could distribute the JDK bundles on a CD with your
    OS, or in a package repository for your OS on your mirror
    distribution sites.

6.  Can projects such as the JPackage Project exercise the DLJ?

    Sun recognizes and encourages the contributions of projects such
    as the JPackage Project ( http://www.jpackage.org ) to the adoption
    of Java technology on GNU/Linux OSs. Such projects are very
    similar to the jdk-distros project that Sun has established,
    providing recommendations for packaging Java technology with OS
    distributions, but not actually distributing an OS. Anyone can
    provide recommendations for packaging under the DLJ, but only
    GNU/Linux and OpenSolaris OS distributors may exercise the DLJ and
    ship the JDK, as the license requires that you ship the JDK
    bundles with an OS.

7.  I distribute my OS online from multiple mirror sites. Does such a
    multi-site online distribution model fit into the definition of
    "online" under this license?

    Yes it does. Each mirror is, in essence, a downstream distributor
    of the original OS bundles from the master site. Accordingly, the
    mirror sites may distribute the JDK as part of these bundles,
    under the terms and conditions of the DLJ.

8.  What are my obligations under this license?

    The license is the best reference for this. Some of the important 
    terms to consider are that you are required to:
    - Keep all copyright and other notices intact.
    - Distribute the entire JDK - no subsetting. Note - the README
      file has the specifics of what you must distribute, and what can
      be omitted.
    - Use the JDK only to design, develop, test, and run Java programs
      on your OS - you may not use it or parts of it for other
      purposes.
    - Present for acceptance any end user licenses that are part of
      the JDK, if such licenses are included in the generic install
      bundle provided to you for repackaging.
    - Redistribute subject to the DLJ - so that downstream users and
      distributors of the JDK are also subject to the DLJ's terms.
    - Indemnify Sun against claims arising from your OS or your
      violation of the DLJ (or any applicable law) Note that you are
      not responsible for changes made to your OS distribution by
      downstream users or distributors when such changes are out of
      your control.
    - Ship only a compatible JDK on your OS. If notified of an
      incompatibility, you must correct it and offer a patch or
      replacement to downstream recipients within 90 days, or stop
      shipment and notify downstream recipients.

9.  What is the README file? Is it part of the license? Why not include 
    it with the rest of the license?

    The README file is explicitly called out in Section 2. License
    Grant as a document that provides specific exceptions and
    restrictions to what you may distribute, and should be considered
    an adjunct to the license. The reason for keeping these details in
    a separate file is simple: it allows us to adjust the technical
    details of what constitutes the "Software" and what parts may be
    redistributed separately or omitted from a distribution without
    revising the license itself. This allows us to more quickly react
    to clarify allowable modifications as additional distributions
    package the JDK and discover modifications that are required to
    ensure compatibility and quality.

    You will find a pointer to the latest version of the README at:
    https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/developer.html

10. May I redistribute the src.zip file?

    This is one of the files listed in the README as being optional,
    but redistributable, so yes.

11. If I am working on alternative technology projects, will I be
    "tainted" by the existence of the src.zip file on my system, or if
    I open this file and examine its contents?

    No. The source in src.zip is licensed as a reference for running,
    designing, developing and testing Java applications, and is an
    integral and useful component of the JDK. Sun maintains that you
    aren't tainted simply by having looked at this code, or having it
    on your hard drive.

12. How do I ensure that my package reproduces all the right copyright 
    notices and proprietary legends as required in Section 2(a)?

    If you make certain that any copyright notices and licenses for
    the packaging are clearly separate from the notices for the Java
    platform, you'll be fine. Just make sure you distribute all the
    notices that are provided as part of the JDK bundles you are
    repackaging. For example in the 1.5.0 bundles, the notices are in
    the following files in the top level directory:

    COPYRIGHT
    LICENSE
    THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt

    These files are the copyright notice for the JRE or JDK packages,
    the license terms (DLJ) for the JRE or JDK packages and the
    copyright notices and license terms for the THIRD PARTY CODE,
    respectively.

13. Can I use the JDK to develop programs that can be run anywhere,
    or only for my OS? Section 2(b) seems to say I can't use the JDK
    for developing arbitrary Java language applications.

    The license allows you and your users to run Java programs from
    any source, and develop Java programs for any platform. If you
    distribute the JDK under this license, you must distribute it with
    your OS, and for the purpose of running and developing Java
    programs on your OS. The DLJ does not give you the right to
    distribute a "naked" version of the JDK without your OS. The
    purpose of the language in 2(b) is to require that you include
    your OS, and to use the JDK only for its normal intended purpose
    of running and developing Java programs.

14. Does this license prevent me shipping any alternative technologies 
    in my OS distribution? 

    The DLJ does not restrict you from shipping any other technologies
    you choose to include in your distribution. However, you can't use
    pieces of the JDK configured in conjunction with any alternative
    technologies to create hybrid implementations, or mingle the code
    from the JDK with non-JDK components of any kind so that they run
    together. It is of course perfectly OK to ship programs or
    libraries that use the JDK. Because this question has caused
    confusion in the past, we want to make this absolutely clear:
    except for these limitations on combining technologies, there is
    nothing in the DLJ intended to prevent you from shipping
    alternative technologies with your OS distribution.

15. So, can I ship Eclipse, or other language implementations like 
    Perl or Python?

    Sun can't give you permission to ship these technologies. Only the
    lawful owners and licensors of those technologies can do that. The
    DLJ doesn't prohibit you from shipping them or from running them.

16. If some program in my OS specifies the option -Xbootclasspath to
    the java command, is that considered a breach of Section 2(c)?

    We realize there is some confusion about this because the
    documentation for the java command at
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html
    makes specific mention of the Binary Code License (BCL). The
    intent of Section 2(c) is not to restrict what end user programs
    do with command line options but rather to ensure that the Sun
    Java platform is not used to create hybrid implementations with
    alternate technologies, or mingle the JDK code with alternate
    technologies so they run together.

17. What do you mean by "Present for acceptance end user licenses"
    (from #8 above)? Do I have to create a click-through license
    display when a user first installs or runs the JDK? Must my users
    accept the license?

    Your users must agree to the license terms for the JDK before
    installing it. While you aren't required to show the DLJ on first
    use or installation, you must inform them that the JDK is licensed
    software and that they must agree to the license before using
    it. A click-through mechanism is the preferred way to do this, but
    at a minimum you must present the license by some appropriate
    means for acceptance. For example, your OS download procedure
    could show the user a page that informs him or her that software
    packages included in the download may contain software licenses to
    which the user must agree before installation, and allow the user
    to review them before download.

    You can leverage your distribution's packaging technology to
    ensure that the license terms have been accepted. For instance, on
    Debian and derivative distributions, you could configure the
    package so that if the debconf key for accepting the DLJ has not
    been pre-accepted, the installation will be canceled if the
    license cannot be presented. The point of presenting the license
    is that an individual, corporation, non-profit or entity which
    will be an end user of the JRE or JDK has had a chance to review
    and agree to the DLJ. If the user or administrator pre-accepts
    the key for DLJ agreement on behalf of herself or her group then
    it is perfectly acceptable to silently install Sun Java on one or
    many computers. This is an excellent example of how you can
    leverage packaging infrastructure to comply with the terms of the
    DLJ in ways that are convenient and expected for your users.

18. How do I redistribute the JDK in my OS, so that downstream
    recipients are subject to the DLJ? Do I need to do anything
    special?

    Nothing special - just be sure to include the license in your JDK
    bundle, and inform your downstream recipients that the JDK is
    subject to the license when they download or install it.

19. What obligations do I assume when I receive the JDK as part of an
    OS distribution, and then turn around and redistribute it, even if
    I don't change a thing?

    When you redistribute the JDK under the DLJ, you are subject to
    its terms. This means that you are granted the rights described in
    the license (provided you remain in compliance with the license
    terms) and assume its obligations, including compatibility
    requirements and indemnification. It doesn't matter whether you
    change the distribution you receive or not. When you redistribute,
    you do so under the terms of the DLJ.

20. Why does Sun ask for indemnification? What indemnification am I
    providing to Sun? I'm concerned that I will be held responsible
    for things over which I have no control.

    Simply put, Sun requires indemnification to limit its exposure for
    issues that are not Sun's fault. If your conduct or your OS
    causes a problem that results in a third-party claim, then Sun
    expects you to take responsibility for it. Note that you are not
    indemnifying Sun against claims that are a result of something in
    Sun's code. You also are not indemnifying Sun against claims due
    to changes that a downstream distributor has made to your OS.

    Since downstream distributors must redistribute the JDK under the
    terms of the DLJ, they are the ones providing indemnification to
    Sun for the changes they've made to your OS - which is now their
    OS for the purposes of this license.

21. What do you mean by "compatible"?

    "Compatible" has a very specific meaning for Java technology, and
    in this license. Specifically, a "Compatible" Implementation" is
    an implementation of the Java SE technology specification that
    meets the requirements of the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).,
    i.e., the compliance tests, tools and documentation which allows
    you to establish whether a particular implementation completely
    and correctly implements the Java SE Specification on a specific
    host platform.

22. Am I required to run the TCK before I distribute the software?

    No, this license does not require that you run the TCK.

23. How do I learn more about the TCK?

    There is a "read-only" version of the Java SE TCK available at
    https://jck.dev.java.net which you can look at to better
    understand the compatibility requirements. The license for this
    is for evaluation purposes only.

24. How do I verify compatibility when I don't have the TCK?

    The DLJ is a binary redistribution license, for a binary that has
    been verified on Sun's supported OS platforms (see
    http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/system-configurations.html ).
    However, it is possible that the combination of Sun's JDK with
    your OS distribution could break compatibility. The jdk-distros
    project was created as a place for Linux, OpenSolaris, and Java
    developers to cooperate on creating new packaging for the JDK,
    solving problems including compatibility issues, and as a
    clearinghouse for best practices, tips and tricks, examples, and
    solutions to common issues. This project includes helpful guides
    to potential problems with compatibility based on Sun's experience
    in creating JDK bundles for supported OS versions. You can use
    this guide to help you discover potential problems before you
    distribute the JDK with your OS.

25. I'd like to test my OS distribution's compatibility. How do I 
    obtain the TCK?

    The TCK is available under a usage license that includes some
    support, and which may be purchased from Sun.

    If you are a qualified not-for-profit organization, you may be
    eligible to obtain the TCK under a scholarship. You can find more
    information about this program and request a scholarship
    application at: http://java.sun.com/scholarship/

    There is a "read-only" version of the Java SE TCK available at
    http://jck.dev.java.net which you can look at to better understand
    the compatibility requirements. The license for this is for
    evaluation purposes only and while it does not allow you to run
    the TCK, it may be helpful in your understanding of its
    requirements.

26. What happens if my OS does not behave compatibly with the JDK?

    Sun provides JDK bundles which have been qualified as compatible
    on several common Linux distributions and on
    Solaris. Incompatibility problems will typically be the result of
    variations between your OS and common distributions. Accordingly
    you should fix any problems you are aware of in your OS before
    distributing the software. The JDK must behave in a compatible
    manner when running on your OS.

27. If I'm aware of problems, can I document them for my users 
    and ship anyway?

    No, you must fix the problems before distributing the software. It
    is worth noting however, that you may document supported and
    unsupported platform configurations such as specific web browsers,
    OS versions, or hardware devices.

28. What if a problem comes up after I distribute the software?

    If Sun becomes aware of a compatibility problem with the JDK
    software on your OS distribution and notifies you about it, then
    you must fix the problem and offer a patch or new version to your
    downstream users and distributors, or stop distributing the
    software within 90 days of being notified. If you stop
    distributing the software, you must also make reasonable attempts
    to notify your users, and anyone who might have downloaded your OS
    distribution. Once your downstream users are notified, they must
    make the same choice (i.e. fix the problem or stop
    using/distributing the software)

    Remember, you are always allowed to discontinue distribution of
    the JDK and make a reasonable attempt to notify your downstream
    users and distributors. For example you can stop shipping Sun Java
    by removing it from the list of currently available software for
    your OS. Sun will consider a stop-ship action to be a suitable
    remedy for any compatibility problems. If at some future time you
    are able to fix the problem, you can resume distribution of the
    JDK under the terms of the DLJ.

29. If I decide to stop-ship, must I remove the JDK from archived and 
    compatible distribution bundles as well?

    No, archived bundles can contain the JDK as long as there are no
    compatibility issues. Removing the JDK from your active
    distribution should be sufficient. For instance, on Debian and
    derivative operating systems, you could remove the Sun Java
    packages from the tag database so that users can no longer install
    them using the conventional method (e.g. apt-get install
    sun-java5-jre).

30. What does Section 12, Export Regulations, mean?

    As a U.S. company, Sun is obligated to comply with U.S. export
    regulations --as well as the regulations of other countries where
    it does business or ships to. One way we comply with this
    obligation is to bring these laws and regulations to your
    attention. Ultimately you are responsible for ensuring that your
    use and distribution of the Software is in accordance with export
    regulations, as well as any other applicable laws.

31. May I use the Java logo to show that I'm including the JDK in my 
    OS distribution? What may I do with Java logos?

    No, you may not use the logo, as the right to use the logo is
    based on acquiring a TCK license and passing the TCK. You may
    state that you include the JDK as part of your description of your
    distribution. This license does not grant any right to use any Sun
    mark or logo.

32. What notification must I give Sun before distributing the JDK?

    You are not required to notify Sun, or register. You might find it
    useful however to post something in the jdk-distros project forums
    so that others interested in similar OS distributions to yours can
    share their experiences with you and you can collaborate with them
    on common issues and solutions.

33. Who can I contact if I have additional questions or comments?

    You can send questions related to the DLJ to DLJfeedback@sun.com
    and/or post comments on the jdk-distros project forums on
    java.net, at http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=94 .

34. Is it okay to use Jython with the JDK?

    The license does not prohibit the use or inclusion of external
    classfiles, such as Jython, in a operating system distribution 
    which includes the JDK.
