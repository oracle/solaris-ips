#
# This file contains example apache configuration snippets to show you how to
# configure apache as a reverse proxy with IPS package depot servers.  The
# document is divided into 2 main sections.
# 
#   Section 1: Generic apache configuration settings we recommend.
#   Section 2a: A simple prefixed proxy config (http://pkg.example.com/myrepo)
#   Section 2b: A load balanced prefixed proxy config (http://pkg.example.com/myrepo)
#
# Sections 2a and 2b are two different configuration alternatives.  Select
# one which most closely matches your site's requirements.
#
# A word on non-prefixed proxy configurations: It is straightforward to run
# a depot server at the "root" of a website hierarchy.  However, in general,
# we *do not* recommend this model.  Instead, use the examples shown below.
# We found that depot urls like http://pkg.example.com are initially convenient
# for users, but rapidly become very difficult to manage as soon as you want to
# have two different repositories.
#

#
# This configuration was most recently tested with Apache 2.2.21, and that
# is the minimum version we recommend.
#
# In this example, substitute for "internal.example.com:10000" the name and port
# number of your backend server.
#

#
# Section 1: Here is some common configuration we use for our production servers.
#

#
# HTTP clients can tell the server that they accept compressed
# data in an HTTP request.  So, we enable apache's DEFLATE filter.
# This can dramatically reduce the over-the-wire size of metadata such
# as catalogs and manifests, which often compress 90%.
#
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html application/javascript text/css text/plain

#
# Packages may contain URL encoded forward slashes. To make sure these are
# not interpreted as directory delimiters Apache can be instructed to just
# leave them as they are. For the "NoDecode" option to work Apache 2.2.18
# or later is required.
#
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

#
# Crank up MaxKeepAliveRequests so that clients can make a large number
# of pipelined requests without closing the connection.  This is
# important for transport v1, so that we can do thousands of file
# transfers over the same connection.  Apache's default is too low: just
# 100.
#
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#maxkeepaliverequests
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 10000

#
# We set the proxy timeout to 30 seconds-- if CherryPy is taking longer
# than that to respond, something is wrong.
ProxyTimeout 30

#
# Make sure that forward proxying is disabled.  See
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyrequests
#
ProxyRequests Off

#
# Section 2a: Basic proxy configuration.

# Here is the basic configuration for a non-load-balanced depot server.
# In this example, we connect
#
#          http://pkg.example.com/myrepo --> internal.example.com:10000
#
# Please note that the repository server (pkg.depotd) should also be configured
# With a pkg/proxy_base setting which names the URL at which it can be accessed.
# This can be done as follows:
#
# svccfg -s pkg/server:default "setprop pkg/proxy_base = astring: http://pkg.example.com/myrepo"
# svcadm refresh pkg/server:default
# svcadm restart pkg/server:default
#
# The pkg client opens 20 parallel connections to the server when performing
# network operations. Make sure the number of depot threads matches the expected
# connections to the server at any given time. The number of threads per depot 
# can be set as follows:
# 
# svccfg -s pkg/server:default "setprop pkg/threads = 200"
# svcadm refresh pkg/server:default
# svcadm restart pkg/server:default

#
# We use nocanon to supress canonicalization of urls-- this is important
# for properly working search (as of search v1).
# 
Redirect /myrepo http://pkg.example.com/myrepo/
ProxyPass /myrepo/ http://internal.example.com:10000 nocanon

#
# Section 2b: Load balanced configurations.
#
# It may also be desirable to run servers behind an apache load balancer.  In
# this example, we connect:
#
#          http://pkg.example.com/myrepo -.---> internal1.example.com:10000
#                                          \--> internal2.exmaple.com:10000
#
# As in section 2a, depot servers must be configured with an appropriate
# proxy_base setting.  See above.
#
<Proxy balancer://pkg-example-com-myrepo>
	#
	# It is advisable to limit the amount of back-end connections to 
	# the number of threads each depot is running divided by the number
	# of depots in the load-balancer setup.
	# Otherwise apache opens more connections to a depot than there are
	# available and they get stalled, which can decrease performance. 
	# Specify the maximum amount of parallel connections to each depot 
	# with the "max=" parameter. 
	# The example below is for two depots each running 200 threads.
	#

	# depot on internal1
        BalancerMember http://internal1.example.com:10000 retry=5 max=100

	# depot on internal2
        BalancerMember http://internal2.example.com:10000 retry=5 max=100
</Proxy>

#
# We use nocanon to supress canonicalization of urls-- this is important
# for properly working search (as of search v1)
# 
Redirect /myrepo http://pkg.example.com/myrepo/
ProxyPass /myrepo/ balancer://pkg-example-com-myrepo nocanon
