NAME
     pkg - image packaging system

DESCRIPTION
     The image packaging system, pkg(5), is a framework which provides for
     software lifecycle management (installation, upgrade, and removal).
     Image packaging manages software in units of packages, which are
     collections of 'actions', defined by a set of key/value pairs and
     possibly a data payload.  In many cases, actions are files found in
     a filesystem, but they also represent other installable objects,
     such as drivers, services, and users.

  Package FMRIs and Versions

     Each package is represented by a fault management resource identifier
     (FMRI) with the scheme 'pkg:'.  The full FMRI for a package consists
     of the scheme, a publisher, the package name, and a version string in
     the following format:

         pkg://opensolaris.org/library/libc@5.11,5.11-0.75:20071001T163427Z

     'opensolaris.org' is the publisher.  'library/libc' is the package
     name.  Although the namespace is hierarchical and arbitrarily deep,
     there is no enforced containment -- the name is essentially arbitrary.

     The version follows the package name, separated by an '@'.  It
     consists of four sequences of numbers, separated by punctuation.  The
     elements in the first three sequences are separated by dots, and the
     sequences are arbitrarily long.

     The first part is the component version.  For components tightly bound
     to OpenSolaris, this will usually be the value of 'uname -r' for that
     version of OpenSolaris.  For a component with its own development
     lifecycle, this sequence will be the dotted release number, such as
     '2.4.10'.

     The second part, following the comma, is the build version, specifying
     what version of OpenSolaris the contents of the package were built on,
     providing a minimum bound on which OpenSolaris version the contents can be
     expected to run successfully.

     The third part, following the dash, is the branch version, a
     versioning component, providing vendor-specific information.  This may
     be incremented when the packaging metadata is changed, independently
     of the component, may contain a build number, or some other
     information.

     The fourth part, following the colon, is a timestamp.  It represents
     when the package was published.

     Many parts of the system, when appropriate, will contract FMRIs when
     displaying them to reduce the volume of information provided.
     Typically, the scheme, publisher, build version, and timestamp will be
     elided, and sometimes the versioning information altogether.

  Actions
     Actions represent the installable objects on a system.  They are
     described in a package's manifest.  Every action consists primarily of
     its name and a key attribute.  Together, these refer to a unique
     object as it follows a version history.  Actions may have other
     attributes.  Some of these will be interpreted directly by the
     packaging system, others may be useful only to the system
     administrator or the end-user.

     The attributes listed below are not an exhaustive set; indeed, the
     attributes which may be attached to an action are arbitrary, and
     indeed, the standard sets are easily augmented to incorporate future
     developments.

  File Actions
     The 'file' action is perhaps the most common action, and represents an
     'ordinary file'.  It references a payload, and has four standard
     attributes:

     path   The filesystem path where the file is installed.  This is a
            file action's key attribute.

     mode   The access permissions (in numeric form) of the file.  These
            are simple permissions only, not ACLs.

     owner  The name of the user which owns the file.

     group  The name of the group which owns the file.

     Other attributes include:

     preserve  This specifies that the file's contents should not be
               overwritten on upgrade if they are determined to have
               changed since it was installed or last upgraded.

               If the value of this attribute is 'renameold', then the
               existing file will be renamed, and the new file will be put
               in its place.

               If the value of this attribute is 'renamenew', then the
               existing file will be left alone, and the new file will be
               installed with a new name.

               If the value of this attribute is 'strawberry', then the
               existing file will be left alone, and the new file will not
               be installed.

     Files may also be 'tasted', and depending on the flavor, may have
     additional interesting attributes.  For ELF files, the following
     attributes are recognized:

     elfarch  The architecture of the ELF file.  This will be the output of
              'uname -p' on the architecture for which the file is built.

     elfbits  This will be '32' or '64'.

     elfhash  This is the hash of the 'interesting' ELF sections in the
              file.  These sections are the ones that are mapped into
              memory when the binary is loaded, except for the section
              containing the CTF data.  These sections are the only ones
              necessary to consider when determining whether two binaries'
              executable behavior will differ.

     original_name This attribute is used to handle editable files moving
                   from package to package or from place to place, or both.
                   The form this takes is the name of the originating package, 
		   followed by a colon and the original path to the file.
		   Any file being deleted is recorded either with its 
		   package and path, or with the value of the original_name
		   attribute if specified.  Any editable file being installed
		   that has the original_name attribute set will use the
		   file of that name if it is deleted as part of the same
		   packaging operation.

  Directory Actions
     The 'directory' action is like the file action in that it represents a
     filesystem object, but a directory instead of an ordinary file.  It
     has the same four standard attributes as the file action, and 'path'
     is the key attribute.

  Link Actions
     The 'link' action represents a symbolic link.  It has two standard
     attributes:

     path    The filesystem path where the symlink is installed.  This is a
             link action's key attribute.

     target  The target of the symlink; the filesystem object to which the
             link resolves.

  Hardlink actions
     The 'hardlink' action represents a hard link.  It has the same
     attributes as the link action, and 'path' is also its key attribute.

  Driver actions
     The 'driver' action represents a device driver.  It does not reference
     a payload: the driver files themselves must be installed as file
     actions.  The following attributes are recognized (see add_drv(1m) for
     more information):

     name         The name of the driver.  This is usually, but not always,
                  the filename of the driver binary.  This is the driver
                  action's key attribute.

     alias        This represents an alias for the driver.  There may be
                  more than one alias attribute for any given driver.
                  There are no special quoting rules necessary.

     class        This represents a driver class.  There may be more than
                  one class attribute for any given driver.

     perms        This represents the filesystem permissions for the
                  driver's device nodes.

     clone_perms  This represents the filesystem permissions for the
                  "clone" driver's minor nodes for this driver.

     policy       This specifies additional security policy for the device.
                  There may be more than one policy attribute for any given
                  driver, but no minor device specification may be present in
                  more than one attribute.

     privs        This specifies privileges used by the driver.  There may
                  be more than one privs attribute for any given driver.

     devlink      This specifies an entry in /etc/devlink.tab.  The value
                  is the exact line to go into the file, with tabs denoted
                  by "\t".  See devlinks(1M) for more information.  There
                  may be more than one devlink attribute for any given
                  driver.

  Depend actions
     The 'depend' action represents an inter-package dependency.  A package
     may depend on another package because the first requires functionality
     in the second for the functionality in the first to work, or even to
     install.  Dependencies may be optional.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     type  The type of the dependency.  If the value is 'require', then the
           dependency is required.  A package cannot be installed if any of
           its required dependencies cannot be satisfied.

           If the value is 'optional', then the dependency is optional.
           Optional dependencies are followed or not depending on image
           policy (see 'Policy' below).

           If the value is 'exclude', then the package is non-functional if
           the dependent package is present on the system.

           If the value is 'incorporate', then the dependency is required,
           but in addition, the version of the dependent package is
           constrained.  See 'Constraints and Freezing' below.

     fmri  The FMRI representing the depended-upon package.

     There is no key attribute for depend actions.

  License actions
    The 'license' action represents a license or other informational
    file associated with the package contents.  A package may deliver
    licenses, disclaimers, or other guidance to the package installer
    through the use of the license action.  The payload of the license
    action will be delivered into the image metadata directory
    associated with the package.

    The following attributes are recognized:

    license  The keyword identifying the license type, for use in
             filter and query operations.

    The 'license' attribute is the key attribute for the license action.

  Legacy actions
    The 'legacy' action represents package data used by a legacy
    packaging system.  The attributes associated with this action are
    added into the legacy system's databases in order that the tools
    querying those databases might operate as if the legacy package were
    actually installed.  In particular, this should be sufficient to
    convince the legacy system that the package named by the 'pkg'
    attribute is installed on the system, so that it may be used to
    satisfy dependencies.

    The following attributes, named in accordance with the parameters on
    pkginfo(4), are recognized:

    category  The value for the CATEGORY parameter.  The default value
              is "system".

    desc      The value for the DESC parameter.

    hotline   The value for the HOTLINE parameter.

    name      The value for the NAME parameter.  The default value is
              "none provided".

    pkg       The abbreviation for the package being installed.  The
              default value is the name from the package's FMRI.

    vendor    The value for the VENDOR parameter.

    version   The value for the VERSION parameter.  The default value is
              the version from the package's FMRI.

    The 'pkg' attribute is the key attribute for the legacy action.

  Set actions
     The 'set' action represents a package-level attribute, such as the
     package description.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     name   The name of the attribute.

     value  The value given to the attribute.

  Group actions
     The 'group' action define a unix group as defined in group(4).  No support
     is present for group passwords.  Groups defined with this action initially
     have no user-list; users may be added with the 'user' action.  The following
     attributes are recognized:

     groupname   The value for the name of the group.
     gid         The groups unique numerical id.  The default value is the first
                 free group under 100.

  User actions
     The 'user' action defines a Unix user as defined in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow,
     /etc/group and /etc/ftpd/ftpusers files.  Users defined with this attribute
     have entries added to the appropriate files.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     username    The unique name of the user

     password    The encryped password of the user.  Default value is '*LK*'. See
                 shadow(4).

     uid         The unique uid of the user. Default value is first free value
                 under 100.

     group       The name of the users primary group.  Must be
                 found in /etc/group

     gcos-field  The value of the gecos field in /etc/passwd.  Default value is
                 username.

     home-dir    The user's home directory.  Default value is '/'.

     login-shell The user's default shell.  Default value is empty.


     group-list  secondary groups to which the user belongs.  See group(4).

     ftpuser     Can be set to "true" or "false".  Determines whether
                 user is allowed to use ftp.  See ftpusers(4).

     lastchng    The number of days between January 1, 1970,  and
                 the  date  that  the password was last modified.
                 Default value is empty.  See shadow(4).

     min         The minimum  number  of  days  required  between
                 password changes. This field must be set to 0 or
                 above to enable password aging.  Default value is
                 empty. See shadow(4).

     max         The maximum  number  of  days  the  password  is
                 valid.  Default value is empty.  See shadow(4).

     warn        The number of days before password expires  that
                 the user is warned.  See shadow(4).

     inactive    The number of days  of  inactivity  allowed  for
                 that  user.  This  is  counted  on a per-machine
                 basis; the information about the last  login  is
                 taken  from  the  machine's  lastlog  file.  See
                 shadow(4).

     expire      An absolute date expressed as the number of days
                 since  the  Unix  Epoch  (January 1, 1970). When
                 this number is reached the login can  no  longer
                 be  used.  For example, an expire value of 13514
                 specifies a login expiration of January 1, 2007.
                 See shadow(4).

     flag        set to empty. See shadow(4).

     content and behavior of the image.

  Policy
     Policies are defined by image properties with boolean values.  The 
     supported policies include:

        flush-content-cache-on-success
            When true, the cache of downloaded files is erased after a 
            successful install of a package.  Default value: False

        send-uuid
            When true, a unique identifier (UUID) that identifies the image
            to the publisher is sent on all requests.  Default value: False
