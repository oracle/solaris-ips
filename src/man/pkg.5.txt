NAME
     pkg - image packaging system

DESCRIPTION
     The image packaging system, pkg(5), is a framework which provides for
     software lifecycle management (installation, upgrade, and removal).
     Image packaging manages software in units of packages, which are
     collections of 'actions', defined by a set of key/value pairs and
     possibly a data payload.  In many cases, actions are files found in
     a filesystem, but they also represent other installable objects,
     such as drivers, services, and users.

  Package FMRIs and Versions
     Each package is represented by a fault management resource identifier
     (FMRI) with the scheme 'pkg:'.  The full FMRI for a package consists
     of the scheme, a publisher, the package name, and a version string in
     the following format:

         pkg://opensolaris.org/library/libc@5.11,5.11-0.75:20071001T163427Z

     'opensolaris.org' is the publisher.  'library/libc' is the package
     name.  Although the namespace is hierarchical and arbitrarily deep,
     there is no enforced containment -- the name is essentially arbitrary.
     The publisher information is optional, but must be preceded by 'pkg://'
     if present.  An FMRI that includes the publisher is often referred to as
     being "fully qualified".  If publisher information is not present, then
     the package name should generally be preceded by 'pkg:/'.

     Packaging clients often allow the scheme of an FMRI to be omitted if it
     does not contain publisher information.  For example, 'pkg:/library/libc'
     may be written as 'library/libc'.  If the scheme is omitted, clients also
     allow omission of all but the last component of a package name for matching
     purposes.  For example, 'library/libc' could be written as 'libc', which
     would then match packages named 'libc' or package names ending in '/libc'.

     A publisher's identifying name is a forward domain name that can be used
     to identify a person, group of persons, or an organization as the source
     of one or more packages.  A publisher name should be constructed from an
     Internet domain name that is owned, managed, or represented by or on
     behalf of a publisher.  Other constructions may lead to collisions and be
     unsafe for general use.

     The version follows the package name, separated by an '@'.  It
     consists of four sequences of numbers, separated by punctuation.  The
     elements in the first three sequences are separated by dots, and the
     sequences are arbitrarily long.  Leading zeros in version components
     (e.g. 01.1 or 1.01) are not permitted, although trailing zeros are
     (e.g. 1.10).

     The first part is the component version.  For components tightly bound
     to the operating system, this will usually be the value of 'uname -r'
     for that version of the operating system.  For a component with its own
     development lifecycle, this sequence will be the dotted release number,
     such as '2.4.10'.

     The second part, which if present must follow a comma, is the build
     version, specifying what version of the operating system the contents
     of the package were built on, providing a minimum bound on which
     operating system version the contents can be expected to run
     successfully.

     The third part, which if present must follow a dash, is the branch
     version, a versioning component, providing vendor-specific information.
     This may be incremented when the packaging metadata is changed,
     independently of the component, may contain a build number, or some
     other information.

     The fourth part, which if present must follow a colon, is a timestamp.
     It represents when the package was published.

     Many parts of the system, when appropriate, will contract FMRIs when
     displaying them, and accept input in shorter forms to reduce the volume
     of information displayed or required.  Typically, the scheme, publisher,
     build version, and timestamp can be elided, and sometimes the versioning
     information altogether.

  Actions
     Actions represent the installable objects on a system.  They are
     described in a package's manifest.  Every action consists primarily of
     its name and a key attribute.  Together, these refer to a unique
     object as it follows a version history.  Actions may have other
     attributes.  Some of these will be interpreted directly by the
     packaging system, others may be useful only to the system
     administrator or the end-user.

     The attributes listed below are not an exhaustive set; indeed, the
     attributes which may be attached to an action are arbitrary, and
     indeed, the standard sets are easily augmented to incorporate future
     developments.

     Certain action attributes cause additional operations to be
     executed outside of the packaging context.  These are documented
     below, under the topic "Actuators".

  File Actions
     The 'file' action is perhaps the most common action, and represents an
     'ordinary file'.  It references a payload, and has four standard
     attributes:

     path   The filesystem path where the file is installed.  This is a
            file action's key attribute.

     mode   The access permissions (in numeric form) of the file.  These
            are simple permissions only, not ACLs.

     owner  The name of the user which owns the file.

     group  The name of the group which owns the file.

     Other attributes include:

     preserve  This specifies that the file's contents should not be
               overwritten on upgrade if they are determined to have
               changed since it was installed or last upgraded.

               If the value of this attribute is 'renameold', then the
               existing file will be renamed, and the new file will be put
               in its place.

               If the value of this attribute is 'renamenew', then the
               existing file will be left alone, and the new file will be
               installed with a new name.

               If the value of this attribute is 'strawberry', then the
               existing file will be left alone, and the new file will not
               be installed.

     Files may also be 'tasted', and depending on the flavor, may have
     additional interesting attributes.  For ELF files, the following
     attributes are recognized:

     elfarch  The architecture of the ELF file.  This will be the output of
              'uname -p' on the architecture for which the file is built.

     elfbits  This will be '32' or '64'.

     elfhash  This is the hash of the 'interesting' ELF sections in
              the file.  These are the sections that are mapped into
              memory when the binary is loaded, and are the only ones
              necessary to consider when determining whether two
              binaries' executable behavior will differ.

     original_name This attribute is used to handle editable files moving
                   from package to package or from place to place, or both.
                   The form this takes is the name of the originating package,
                   followed by a colon and the original path to the file.
                   Any file being deleted is recorded either with its
                   package and path, or with the value of the original_name
                   attribute if specified.  Any editable file being installed
                   that has the original_name attribute set will use the
                   file of that name if it is deleted as part of the same
                   packaging operation.

     revert-tag This attribute is used to tag editable files that should
                be reverted as a set.  Multiple revert-tag values may
                be specified; the file will revert to its manifest-defined
                state when pkg revert is invoked with any of those tags
                specified.  See pkg(1).

  Directory Actions
     The 'dir' action is like the file action in that it represents a
     filesystem object, but a directory instead of an ordinary file.  It
     has the same four standard attributes as the file action, and 'path'
     is the key attribute.

     If a package operation triggers a directory removal, the client can
     take two possible actions.  It will either preserve the directory,
     or will move its contents into $IMAGE_META/lost+found.  See FILES
     for more information about $IMAGE_META.  Directory removal
     typically occurs during an uninstall operation, but it may also
     occur during an update from one version to another.

  Link Actions
     The 'link' action represents a symbolic link.  It has two standard
     attributes:

     path    The filesystem path where the symlink is installed.  This is a
             link action's key attribute.

     target  The target of the symlink; the filesystem object to which the
             link resolves.

  Hardlink actions
     The 'hardlink' action represents a hard link.  It has the same
     attributes as the link action, and 'path' is also its key attribute.

  Driver actions
     The 'driver' action represents a device driver.  It does not reference
     a payload: the driver files themselves must be installed as file
     actions.  The following attributes are recognized (see add_drv(1m) for
     more information):

     name         The name of the driver.  This is usually, but not always,
                  the filename of the driver binary.  This is the driver
                  action's key attribute.

     alias        This represents an alias for the driver.  There may be
                  more than one alias attribute for any given driver.
                  There are no special quoting rules necessary.

     class        This represents a driver class.  There may be more than
                  one class attribute for any given driver.

     perms        This represents the filesystem permissions for the
                  driver's device nodes.

     clone_perms  This represents the filesystem permissions for the
                  "clone" driver's minor nodes for this driver.

     policy       This specifies additional security policy for the device.
                  There may be more than one policy attribute for any given
                  driver, but no minor device specification may be present in
                  more than one attribute.

     privs        This specifies privileges used by the driver.  There may
                  be more than one privs attribute for any given driver.

     devlink      This specifies an entry in /etc/devlink.tab.  The value
                  is the exact line to go into the file, with tabs denoted
                  by "\t".  See devlinks(1M) for more information.  There
                  may be more than one devlink attribute for any given
                  driver.

  Depend actions
     The 'depend' action represents an inter-package dependency.  A package
     may depend on another package because the first requires functionality
     in the second for the functionality in the first to work, or even to
     install.  Dependencies may be optional.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     type  The type of the dependency.  If the value is 'require', then the
           dependency is required.  A package cannot be installed if any of
           its required dependencies cannot be satisfied.

           If the value is 'optional', then the dependency, if present, must
	   be at the specified version level or greater.

           If the value is 'exclude', then the containing package cannot
	   be installed if the dependency is present at the specified
	   version level or greater.

           If the value is 'incorporate', then the dependency is
           optional, but the version of the dependent package will
           become constrained.  See 'Constraints and Freezing' below.

           If the value is 'require-any', then any one of multiple dependent
           packages as specified by multiple 'fmri' attributes will satisfy
           the dependency

           If the value is 'conditional', the dependency is required
           only if the package defined by the predicate attribute is present
           on the system.

           If the value is 'origin', the dependency must, if present,
           be at the specified value or better on the image to be modified
           prior to installation.  If the value of the 'root-image' attribute
           is 'true', the dependency must be present on the image rooted at '/'
           in order to install this package.

           If the value is 'group', the dependency is required unless the
	   package is on the image avoid list.  Note that obsolete packages
	   silently satisfy the group dependency.  See the avoid subcommand
           in pkg(1).

     fmri  The FMRI representing the depended-upon package.  It must not
           include the publisher.  In the case of require-any dependencies,
           there may be multiple values.  This is the dependency action's
           key attribute.

     predicate  The FMRI representing the predicate for 'conditional'
           dependencies.

     root-image Has an effect only for origin dependencies as mentioned
           above.

  License actions
    The 'license' action represents a license or other informational
    file associated with the package contents.  A package may deliver
    licenses, disclaimers, or other guidance to the package installer
    through the use of the license action.

    The payload of the license action will be delivered into the image
    metadata directory related to the package, and should only contain
    human-readable textual data.  It should not contain HTML or any
    other form of markup. License actions, through attributes, may
    indicate to clients that the related payload must be displayed
    and/or require "acceptance" of it.  Please note that the exact
    method of display and/or acceptance is at the discretion of
    clients.

    The following attributes are recognized:

    license         This attribute provides a meaningful description
                    for the license to assist users in determining
                    the contents without reading the license text
                    itself.  Some example values might include:

                    "ABC Co. Copyright Notice"
                    "ABC Co. Custom License"
                    "Common Development and Distribution License 1.0 (CDDL)"
                    "GNU General Public License 2.0 (GPL)"
                    "GNU General Public License 2.0 (GPL) Only"
                    "MIT License"
                    "Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL)"
                    "Simplified BSD License"

                    Wherever possible, including the version of the
                    license in the description is recommended as shown
                    above.  This value must be unique within a package.

    must-accept     When "true", this license must be accepted by a
                    user before the related package can be installed
                    or updated.  Omission of this attribute will be
                    considered equivalent to "false".  The method of
                    acceptance (interactive, configuration-based,
                    etc.) is at the discretion of clients.

    must-display    When "true", the action's payload must be displayed
                    by clients during packaging operations.  Omission of
                    this value is considered equivalent to "false".
                    This attribute should not be used for copyright
                    notices, only actual licenses or other material
                    that must be displayed during operations.  The
                    method of display is at the discretion of
                    clients.

    The 'license' attribute is the key attribute for the license action.

  Legacy actions
    The 'legacy' action represents package data used by a legacy
    packaging system.  The attributes associated with this action are
    added into the legacy system's databases in order that the tools
    querying those databases might operate as if the legacy package were
    actually installed.  In particular, this should be sufficient to
    convince the legacy system that the package named by the 'pkg'
    attribute is installed on the system, so that it may be used to
    satisfy dependencies.

    The following attributes, named in accordance with the parameters on
    pkginfo(4), are recognized:

    category  The value for the CATEGORY parameter.  The default value
              is "system".

    desc      The value for the DESC parameter.

    hotline   The value for the HOTLINE parameter.

    name      The value for the NAME parameter.  The default value is
              "none provided".

    pkg       The abbreviation for the package being installed.  The
              default value is the name from the package's FMRI.

    vendor    The value for the VENDOR parameter.

    version   The value for the VERSION parameter.  The default value is
              the version from the package's FMRI.

    The 'pkg' attribute is the key attribute for the legacy action.

  Set actions
     The 'set' action represents a package-level attribute, or metadata,
     such as the package description.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     name   The name of the attribute.

     value  The value given to the attribute.

     The set action can deliver any metadata the package author chooses;
     however, there are a number of well-defined attribute names which have
     specific meaning to the packaging system.

     info.classification   One or more tokens which a pkg(5) client may use
                           to classify the package.  The value should have
                           a scheme (such as "org.opensolaris.category.2008"
                           or "org.acm.class.1998") and the actual
                           classification, such as "Applications/Games",
                           separated by a colon (:).

     pkg.description       A detailed description of the contents and
                           functionality of the package, typically a
                           paragraph or so in length.

     pkg.obsolete          When "true", the package is marked obsolete.  An
                           obsolete package may have no actions other than
                           more set actions, and must not be marked renamed.

     pkg.renamed           When "true", the package has been renamed.
                           There must be one or more "depend" actions in
                           the package as well which point to the package
                           versions to which this package has been renamed.
                           A package may not be marked both renamed and
                           obsolete, but otherwise may have any number of
                           set actions.

     pkg.summary           A short, one-line description of the package.

  Group actions
     The 'group' action defines a Unix group as defined in group(4).
     No support is present for group passwords.  Groups defined with
     this action initially have no user-list; users may be added with
     the 'user' action.  The following attributes are recognized:

     groupname   The value for the name of the group.

     gid         The groups unique numerical id.  The default value is the first
                 free group under 100.

  User actions
     The 'user' action defines a Unix user as defined in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow,
     /etc/group and /etc/ftpd/ftpusers files.  Users defined with this attribute
     have entries added to the appropriate files.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     username    The unique name of the user

     password    The encrypted password of the user.  Default value is '*LK*'.
                 See shadow(4).

     uid         The unique uid of the user. Default value is first free value
                 under 100.

     group       The name of the users primary group.  Must be
                 found in /etc/group

     gcos-field  The value of the gecos field in /etc/passwd.  Default value is
                 username.

     home-dir    The user's home directory.  Default value is '/'.

     login-shell The user's default shell.  Default value is empty.

     group-list  secondary groups to which the user belongs.  See group(4).

     ftpuser     Can be set to "true" or "false".  The default value
                 of "true" indicates that the user is permitted to
                 login via FTP.  See ftpusers(4).

     lastchng    The number of days between January 1, 1970,  and
                 the  date  that  the password was last modified.
                 Default value is empty.  See shadow(4).

     min         The minimum  number  of  days  required  between
                 password changes. This field must be set to 0 or
                 above to enable password aging.  Default value is
                 empty. See shadow(4).

     max         The maximum  number  of  days  the  password  is
                 valid.  Default value is empty.  See shadow(4).

     warn        The number of days before password expires  that
                 the user is warned.  See shadow(4).

     inactive    The number of days  of  inactivity  allowed  for
                 that  user.  This  is  counted  on a per-machine
                 basis; the information about the last  login  is
                 taken  from  the  machine's  lastlog  file.  See
                 shadow(4).

     expire      An absolute date expressed as the number of days
                 since  the  Unix  Epoch  (January 1, 1970). When
                 this number is reached the login can  no  longer
                 be  used.  For example, an expire value of 13514
                 specifies a login expiration of January 1, 2007.
                 See shadow(4).

     flag        set to empty. See shadow(4).


  Actuators

     In certain contexts, additional operations may be appropriate to
     execute in preparation for or following the introduction of a
     particular action.  These additional operations are generally
     needed only on a live system image, and are operating
     system-specific.  When multiple actions involved in a package
     installation or removal have identical actuators, then the
     operation corresponding to actuator presence is executed once for
     that installation or removal.

     Incorrectly specified actuators may result in package installation
     failure, if the actuator cannot determine a means of making
     safe installation progress.

     The following actuators are defined:

     reboot-needed  Can be set to "true" or "false".  If an action
                 with this actuator set to "true" is installed or
                 updated during a package installation, then the
                 packaging transaction can be advertised as requiring a
                 reboot.  Certain client implementations may take
                 additional steps, such as performing the entire package
                 operation using a clone of the image, in the case that
                 the image is the live system image.

     disable_fmri
     refresh_fmri
     restart_fmri
     suspend_fmri  Each of these actuators take the value of an FMRI of
                 a service instance to operate upon during the package
                 installation or removal.  disable_fmri causes the
                 mentioned FMRI to be disabled prior to action removal, per
                 the disable subcommand to svcadm(1M).  refresh_fmri and
                 restart_fmri cause the given FMRI to be refreshed or
                 restarted after action installation or update, per the
                 respective subcommands of svcadm(1M).  Finally,
                 suspend_fmri causes the given FMRI to be disabled
                 temporarily prior to the action install phase, and then
                 enabled after the completion of that phase.

                 The value may contain a pattern matching multiple service
                 instances.   However, it must do so explicitly with a glob
                 as accepted by svcs(1), rather than doing so implicitly by
                 not indicating any instances.

  Properties
     Images can have one or more properties associated with them.
     These properties can be used to store information about the purpose,
     content and behavior of the image.

  Image Policies
     Policies are defined by image properties with boolean values.  The
     supported policies include:

        flush-content-cache-on-success
            When true, the cache of downloaded files is erased after a
            successful install of a package.  Default value: False.

        send-uuid
            When true, a unique identifier (UUID) that identifies the
            image to the publisher is sent on all requests.  Default
            value: True.

FILES
     Since pkg(5) images can be located arbitrarily within a larger file
     system, we use the token $IMAGE_ROOT to distinguish relative paths.
     For a typical system installation, $IMAGE_ROOT is equivalent to
     "/".

     $IMAGE_ROOT/var/pkg
         Metadata directory for a full or partial image.

     $IMAGE_ROOT/.org.opensolaris,pkg
         Metadata directory for a user image.

     Within a particular image's metadata, certain files and directories
     can contain information useful during repair and recovery.  We use
     the token $IMAGE_META to refer to the top-level directory
     containing the metadata.  $IMAGE_META is typically one of the two
     paths given above.

     $IMAGE_META/lost+found
         Location of conflicting directories and files moved during a
         package operation.

     $IMAGE_META/publisher
         Contains a directory for each publisher.  Each directory stores
         publisher-specific metadata.

     Other paths within the $IMAGE_META directory hierarchy are Private,
     and are subject to change.
