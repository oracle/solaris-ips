NAME
     pkgdiff - compare pkg manifests

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/pkgdiff [-i attribute] [-o attribute] ...  file1 file2


DESCRIPTION
     pkgdiff compares two package manifests and reports on differences.
     pkgdiff sorts each manifest & action into a consistent order before
     comparison.

     Output is of the form:

     + <complete action> if this action is in file2 but not in file1
     - <complete action> if this action is in file1 but not in file2

     actionname keyvalue <variant values, if any>
       - attribute1=value1         if this attribute,value is in file1
                                   but not in file2
       + attribute2=value2         if this attribute,value is in file2
                                   but not in file1

     Note that actions with different variants but the same type and key
     attribute value are treated as separate actions for purposes of
     comparison, so actions changing attributes will appear in their
     complete form rather than as attribute changes.

OPTIONS

     -i attribute    Ignore this attribute if present during comparisons
                     File hash values may be ignored with -i hash.  May
                     not be used with -o option.

     -o attribute    Only report differences in this attribute.   May
                     not be used with -i option.  Will elide any action
                     changes that don't affect this attribute on an action.

     The following exit values are returned:

     0     No differences were found

     1     Differences were found
