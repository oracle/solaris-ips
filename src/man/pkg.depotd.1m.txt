DESCRIPTION
     pkg.depotd is the depot server for the image packaging system.
     pkg(1), the retrieval client, makes requests of the depot server
     for catalogs and packages.  pkgsend(1), the publication client,
     sends new versions of packages to the depot server.  pkg.depotd is
     typically run as a service on the system.  Package and software
     developers may wish to run private copies for various testing
     purposes.

     The pkg.depot server is generally configured via the smf(5) properties
     associated with its service.  The following properties are recognized:

     pkg/cfg_file               (astring) The pathname of the file from which
                                to read and to write configuration information.

     pkg/content_root           (astring) The file system path at which
                                the instance should find its static
                                and other web content.  The default
                                value is /usr/share/lib/pkg.

     pkg/debug                  (astring) A comma-separated list of debug
                                features to enable.  Possible values are:

                                  headers
                                        Logs the headers of every request to
                                        the error log.

     pkg/inst_root              (astring) The file system path at which
                                the instance should find its repository
                                data.  The default value is
                                /var/pkg/repo.

     pkg/log_access             (astring) The destination for any access
                                related information logged by the depot
                                process.  Possible values are: stderr,
                                stdout, none, or an absolute pathname.
                                The default value is stdout if stdout is
                                a tty; otherwise the default value is
                                none.

     pkg/log_errors             (astring) The destination for any errors
                                or other information logged by the depot
                                process.  Possible values are: stderr,
                                stdout, none, or an absolute pathname.
                                The default value is stderr.

     pkg/mirror                 (boolean) Sets whether package mirror mode 
                                is used. When true, publishing and metadata
                                operations are disabled and only a limited
                                browser user interface is provided. This
                                property may not be true when pkg/readonly is
                                true. The default value is false.

     pkg/port                   (count) The port number on which the
                                instance should listen for incoming
                                package requests.  The default value is
                                80 if ssl certificate and key information has
                                not been provided; otherwise, the default
                                value is 443.

     pkg/proxy_base             (uri) This changes the base URL for the
                                depot server and is most useful when
                                running behind Apache or some other
                                webserver in a reverse proxy
                                configuration.

     pkg/readonly               (boolean) Sets whether modifying operations, 
                                such as those initiated by pkgsend(1M) are 
                                disabled. Retrieval operations are still 
                                available. This property may not be true
                                when pkg/mirror is true. The default value
                                is false.

     pkg/socket_timeout         (count) The maximum number of seconds the
                                server should wait for a response from a
                                client before closing a connection.  The
                                default value is 60.

     pkg/ssl_cert_file          (astring) The absolute pathname to a PEM-
                                encoded Certificate file.  The default
                                value is none.  This property must be used
                                with ssl_key_file.  The depot will only
                                respond to SSL requests if provided.

     pkg/ssl_dialog             (astring) Specifies what method should be
                                used to obtain the passphrase needed to de-
                                crypt the ssl_key_file.  Possible values
                                are: builtin, exec:/path/to/program or
                                smf:fmri.  builtin will prompt for the
                                passphrase; exec will execute the specified
                                external program to obtain the passphrase,
                                which should be printed to stdout.  The first
                                argument to the program will be '', and is
                                reserved.  The second argument to the
                                program will be the port number of the
                                server.  smf:fmri will attempt to retrieve
                                the value of pkg_secure/ssl_key_passphrase
                                from the service instance related to the
                                fmri.  The default value is builtin.

     pkg/ssl_key_file           (astring) The absolute pathname to a PEM-
                                encoded Private Key file.  This property
                                must be used with ssl_cert_file.  The
                                depot will only respond to SSL requests
                                if provided.

     pkg/threads                (count) The number of threads that will
                                be started to serve requests.  The default
                                value is 10.

     pkg_secure/ssl_key_passphrase      (astring) The password to use to
                                        decrypt the pkg/ssl_key_file.  This
                                        value is read-authorization
                                        protected.

OPTIONS
     The following options alter the default behavior, if present, and
     will override the settings from the service instance when managed
     via an smf(5) restarter:

     -d repo_dir                Overrides pkg/inst_root with the value

                                This option may not be combined with the

                                in this directory, although their content
                                may differ from the supplied default
                                content.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Successful operation.

     1     Error encountered.

     2     Invalid command line options were specified.

FILES
     /var/pkg/repo              Default repository location; modify
                                pkg/inst_root to select an
                                alternate location.

     /usr/share/lib/pkg         Default presentation content location;
                                modify pkg/content_root to select an
                                alternate location.

NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all subject
     to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris community
     at:

     http://opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/

     The pkd.depotd service is managed by the service  management
     facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:

          svc:/application/pkg/server

     Because the depot server expects to be run by an smf(5) restarter,
     it does not daemonize.  Error messages are generally sent to
     standard output, or to the syslogd(1M) system.

     Changes to configuration require a restart of the depot server process
     so that they can be reflected in operations and output.  This must be
     done when the server is not operating in read-only or mirror mode.
