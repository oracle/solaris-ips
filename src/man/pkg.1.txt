DESCRIPTION
     pkg is the retrieval client for the image packaging system.  With
     a valid configuration, pkg can be invoked to create locations for
     packages to be installed, called 'images', and install packages
     into those images.  Packages are published by publishers, who may
     make their packages available at one or more repositories.  pkg,
     then, retrieves packages from a publisher's repository and
     installs them into an image.

     A publisher is a forward domain name that can be used to identify a
     person, group of persons, or an organization as the source of one or
     more packages.  The name of a publisher does not have to be contained
     within the URIs that identify the locations of publisher repositories.
     For example, the name of a publisher might be "example.com", but its
     repositories may be hosted at "example.org" or "example.net".

     A repository is a location where clients can publish and retrieve
     package content (files contained within the package such as programs,
     documents, etc.) and metadata (information about the package such as
     its name, description, etc.).  As an example, a publisher named
     "example.org" may have their repository located at the URI
     "http://example.org/repository".

     pkg can also uninstall packages, refresh publisher metadata (such as
     catalogs), validate package installation in an image, and query the
     image for various tokens.  These queries can also be made of pkg(5)
     repositories.

     Images can be of three types: full images, capable of providing a
     complete system; partial images, which are linked to a full image
     (parent image), but do not provide a complete system on their own;
     and user images, which contain only relocatable packages.  (See
     NOTES on user images.)

     pkg(1) attempts to determine, based on its working directory, in
     what image it has been invoked.  If no image metadata can be found
     in the parent directories, the invocation will fail.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -R dir
          Operate on the image rooted at dir, rather than the one discovered
          automatically.

     --help or -?
          Displays a usage message.

SUBCOMMANDS
     The following subcommands are supported:

     image-create [-FPUfz] [--force] [--full|--partial|--user] [--zone]
       [-k ssl_key] [-c ssl_cert] [--no-refresh]
       [--variant <variant_spec>=<instance> ...]
       [-g uri|--origin=uri ...] [-m uri|--mirror=uri ...]
       [--facet <facet_spec>=[True|False] ...]
       (-p|--publisher) [<name>=]<repo_uri> dir
          Create, at location given by dir, an image suitable for package
          operations.  The default image type is user, as given by the -U
          (--user) option.  The image type may be set to a full image (-F
          or --full) or to a partial image (-P or --partial) linked to the
          full image enclosing the given dir path.  Additional origins can
          be specified using -g or --origin, while additional mirrors can
          be specified using -m or --mirror.

          A package repository URI must be provided using the -p or
          --publisher option.  If a publisher name is also provided, then
          only that publisher will be added when the image is created.  If
          a publisher name is not provided, then all publishers known by the
          specified repository will be added to the image.  An attempt to
          retrieve the catalog associated with this publisher will be made
          following the initial creation operations.

          For publishers using client SSL authentication, a client key and
          client certificate may be registered via the -c and -k options,
          and will be used for all publishers added during image creation.

          If the image is to be run within nonglobal zone context, then
          the -z (--zone) option can be used to set an appropriate filter.

          With -f (--force), force the creation of an image over an existing
          image.  This option should be used with care.

          With --no-refresh, do not attempt to contact the repositories for
          the image's publishers to retrieve publisher metadata (e.g.
          catalogs).

          With --variant, set the specified variant to the indicated value.

          With --facet, set the specified facet to the indicated value.

     refresh [--full] [publisher ...]
          Retrieve updates to the metadata (e.g. catalogs) for each publisher
          specified.  When given no arguments, retrieves updates for each
          publisher registered within the image.

          With --full, retrieve all publisher metadata instead of attempting an
          incremental update.

     install [-nvq] [--accept] [--licenses] [--no-index] [--no-refresh]
       [--deny-new-be | --require-new-be] [--be-name] pkg_fmri_pattern ...

          Installs and updates packages to the newest version that match
          pkg_fmri_pattern allowed by the packages installed in the
          image.

          Some configuration files may be renamed or replaced during the
          install process.  For more information on how the package system
          determines which files to preserve, and how they are preserved
          during package operations, see "File Actions" in pkg(5).

          With the -n option, execute the requested operation but make
          no persistent changes to the image.

          With the -v option, issue verbose progress messages during
          the requested operation.  With the -q option, issue no
          progress messages during the requested operation.

          With --accept, you indicate that you agree to and accept the
          terms of the licenses of the packages that are updated or
          installed.  If you do not provide this option, and any
          package licenses require acceptance, the operation will
          fail.

          With --licenses, display all of the licenses for the
          packages that will be installed or updated as part of this
          operation.

          With --no-index, do not update the search indices after the
          operation has completed successfully.

          With --no-refresh, do not attempt to contact the
          repositories for the image's publishers to retrieve
          publisher metadata (e.g. catalogs).

          With --be-name, rename the newly created boot environment to
          be the argument given.  This option is only valid if a new
          boot environment is created during the operation.  See also
          beadm(1m).

          With --require-new-be, always create a new boot environment.
          Without this option, a boot environment is created
          automatically if needed.

          With --deny-new-be, disallow creation of a new boot
          environment; the operation will not be performed if
          a new boot environment is required.

     uninstall [-nrvq] [--no-index] [--deny-new-be | --require-new-be]
       [--be-name name] pkg_fmri_pattern ...

          Removes installed packages that match pkg_fmri_pattern.

          With -r, recursively uninstall any packages that contain
          'require' dependencies on the initial package.  (Packages
          containing 'optional' or 'incorporate' dependencies are
          not included in the removal.)

          For all other options, refer to the install command above
          for usage and their effects.

     update [-fnvq] [--accept] [--be-name name] [--licenses]
       [--no-index] [--no-refresh] [--deny-new-be | --require-new-be]
       [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]

          With no arguments, or if '*' is one of the patterns provided,
          update all installed packages in the current image to the newest
          version allowed by the constraints imposed on the system by
          installed packages and publisher configuration.

          If pkg_fmri_pattern is provided, update will replace packages
          that are installed, and that match pkg_fmri_pattern, with the
          newest version allowed by the pattern(s) and the constraints
          imposed on the system by installed packages and publisher
          configuration.  Versions older or newer than what is already
          installed may be specified to perform in place downgrades or
          upgrades of specific packages.  Please note that updating
          specific packages across package rename or obsolete boundaries
          is not supported.

          Any preserved configuration files that are part of packages to
          be downgraded by update and that have been changed since the
          original version was installed will be renamed using the
          extension '.update'.  For more information on how the package
          system determines which files to preserve, and how these files
          are preserved during package upgrades, see "File Actions" in
          pkg(5).

          With the -f option, don't execute the client up to date check
          when updating all installed packages.

          For all other options, refer to the install command above for
          usage and their effects.

     info [-lr] [--license] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Display information about packages in a human-readable form.
          Multiple FMRI patterns may be specified; with no patterns,
          display information on all installed packages in the image.

          With -l, use the data available from locally installed packages.
          This is the default.

          With -r, retrieve the data from the repositories of the image's
          configured publishers.  Note that you must specify one or more
          package patterns in this case.

          With --license, print out the license text(s) for the package.
          This may be combined with -l or -r.

     contents [-Hmr] [-a attribute=pattern ...] [-o attribute ...]
       [-s sort_key] [-t action_type ...] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Display the contents (action attributes) of packages in the
          current image.  By default, only the path attribute is displayed,
          but the attribute set may be determined with the -o option.  The
          -o option may be specified multiple times, or multiple attributes
          may be specified as the argument to one -o option by separating
          the attribute names with commas.  Only actions which have the
          requested attributes will be displayed.  The -m option may
          also be used, as a shorthand for '-Ho action.raw'.

          The -a option allows you to limit the output to those actions
          which have an attribute named in the option argument the value of
          which matches the (glob) pattern in the option argument
          (following the attribute name with an equals sign).  If multiple
          -a options are given, then actions matching any of them will be
          displayed.

          The -s option specifies the attribute by which the listing should
          be sorted.

          The -t option limits the action types which will be displayed.

          The -H option causes the headers to be omitted.

          The -r option retrieves the requested data from the repositories
          of the image's configured publishers.  This option is intended
          to be used when the named packages are not already installed.

          With no arguments, the output includes all installed packages.
          Alternatively, multiple FMRI patterns may be specified, which
          restricts the display to the contents of the matching packages.
          When using -r, one or more pkg_fmri_patterns must be specified.

          Several special "pseudo" attribute names are available for
          convenience:

          action.hash           Corresponds to the value of the action's
                                hash, if the action carries a payload.

          action.key            Corresponds to the value of the action's
                                key attribute.  For example, for a file
                                action, this is the path to the file.

          action.name           Corresponds to the name of the action.
                                For example, for a file action, this is
                                "file"

          action.raw            Corresponds to the complete contents of
                                the action as represented in the package
                                manifest.  This corresponds to the
                                lines of output of 'pkg contents -m'

          pkg.fmri              Corresponds to the full form FMRI of the
                                package containing the action, such as
                                pkg://extra/virtualbox@3.0.0,5.11-0.101:20090702T175410Z

          pkg.name              Corresponds to the name of the package
                                containing the action, such as "SUNWcs"

          pkg.publisher         Corresponds to the publisher of the
                                the package containing the action, such
                                as "opensolaris.org"

          pkg.shortfmri         Corresponds to the short form FMRI of the
                                package containing the action, such as
                                pkg://opensolaris.org/SUNWzone@0.5.11-0.79

          The contents and search subcommands are related: both are used to
          query the system for the contents of packages.  The contents
          subcommand displays actions in one or more packages, filtering
          the output based on the options chosen by the user.  The search
          subcommand approaches the query from the other direction, looking
          for packages which contain a user-supplied token.

          Each subcommand is capable of formulating some queries of which
          the other is capable.  Care should be taken in choosing the
          subcommand, as a given query may be more naturally formulated in
          one than in the other.

     search [-HIaflpr] [-o attribute ...] [-s repo_uri] query
          Search for matches to the query, and display the results.
          Which tokens are indexed are action-dependent, but may
          include content hashes and pathnames.  By default, queries are
          interpreted as a series of terms to be matched exactly.  The
          '?' and '*' characters can be used as glob(3C)-style
          wildcards, allowing more flexible query matches.

          With -H, omit the headers.

          With -I, use a case-sensitive search.

          By default, and with -a, perform the search and display information
          about the matching actions.

          By default, search prunes results from packages older than the 
          currently installed version and from package versions excluded by 
          current incorporations.  Use -f to show all results, regardless of 
          package version.

          With -l, search the image's installed packages.

          With -o, the columns of the results may be controlled.  The
          -o option may be specified multiple times, or multiple attributes
          may be specified as the argument to one -o option by separating
          the attribute names with commas.  In addition to the "pseudo"
          attributes outlined above, more are defined for search results:

          search.match          Corresponds to the string which matched the
                                search query.

          search.match_type     Corresponds to the attribute which contained
                                the string that matched the search query.

          With -p, display packages which have some actions that match each 
          query term.  Using this option is equivalent to putting '<>' around 
          each term  in the query.  (For a description of the '<>' operator, 
          please see below.)

          By default, and with -r, search the repositories corresponding
          to the image's publishers.

          With -s, search the pkg(5) repository located at the given URI.
          This may be specified multiple times.

          Both -l and -r (or -s) may be specified together, in which case both
          local and remote searches will be performed.

          In addition to simple token matching and wildcard search, a more
          complicated query language is supported.  Phrases may be searched for
          by using ' or ".  Note: Please make sure to take your shell into
          account so that pkg actually sees the ' or ".

          Boolean search using AND and OR is supported.  Field, or structured,
          queries are supported.  The syntax for these is
          pkg_name:action_type:key:token.  Missing fields are implicitly
          wildcarded.  A search for :basename:pkg would match all actions
          types in all packages with a key of basename and which matched
          the token 'pkg'.  Explicit wildcards are supported in the pkg_name
          and token fields, action_type and key must match exactly.

          To convert actions to the packages which contain those actions,
          use '<>'.  With the -a option, Searching for 'token' results in
          information about the actions matching token, while searching for
          '<token>' results in a list of packages containing actions which
          matched token.

     list [-Hafnsuv] [--no-refresh] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Display a list of packages in the current image, including
          state and other information.  By default, package variants
          for a different architecture or zone type are excluded.
          The usual output is in four columns:

            NAME (PUBLISHER)                  VERSION          STATE      UFOXI
            SUNWcs                            0.5.11-0.126     installed  -----
            web/firefox/plugin/flash (extra)  10.0.32.18-0.111 installed  -----

          The first column contains the name of the package.  If the publisher
          from which it is installed (or available, if not installed) is not
          the preferred publisher, then the publisher name is listed in
          parentheses after the package name.  The second column contains the
          release and branch versions of the package (see pkg(5)).  The third
          column contains the state of the package as it exists on the system.
          Possible values are "installed" and "known".  The last column
          contains a set of flags that show how the package relates to other
          packages:

              - a "u" in the "U" column shows that a newer version is
                available, although it may not be possible to install
                this newer version due to package dependencies or
                constraints;

              - an "f" in the "F" column shows that this version has
                been frozen (not implemented);

              - an "o" in the "O" column shows that it is obsolete,
                while an "r" shows that it has been renamed (a form of
                obsoletion);

              - an "x" in the "X" column shows that it is prevented from
                being installed because some other package has excluded
                it (not implemented); and

              - an "i" in the "I" column shows that it has been
                constrained by an incorporation (not implemented).

          With -H, omit the headers from the listing.

          With -a, list installed packages and the newest version of
          packages that are available for installation.  Packages are
          considered to be available for installation if they are
          allowed by the installed incorporations and by the image's
          variants.  If one or more patterns are specified, then the
          newest version matching the specified pattern and is also
          allowed by any installed incorporations and the image's
          variants will be listed.  Without -a, list only installed
          packages.

          With -f and -a, list all versions of all packages for all
          variants regardless of incorporation constraints or installed
          state.

          With -n, display the newest versions of all known packages,
          regardless of installed state.

          With -s, display a one-line short-form giving the package name
          and description.  This option may be used with -a, -n, -u or
          -v.

          With -u, list only packages with newer versions available.

          With -v, show full package FMRIs, including publisher and
          complete version, all in the first column (the VERSION column
          disappears).  This option may be used with -a, -n, or -u.

          With --no-refresh, do not attempt to contact the repositories
          for the image's publishers to retrieve publisher metadata (e.g.
          catalogs).

     verify [-Hqv] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Validate the installation of packages in the current image.
          Please note that verification of installed package content is
          based on a custom content analysis that may return different
          results than those of other programs.

          With -H, omit the headers from the verification output.

          With -q, print nothing, but return failure if there are any
          fatal errors.

          With -v, include informational messages regarding packages.

     variant [-H] [<variant_spec> ...]

          With the -n option, plan the requested operation but make
          no actual changes.

          With the -v option, issue verbose progress messages during the
          requested operation.  With the -q option, be completely silent.

          With --accept, you indicate that you agree to and accept the
          terms of the licenses of the packages that are updated or
          installed.  If you do not provide this option, and any package
          licenses require acceptance, the operation will fail.

          With --licenses, display all of the licenses for the packages that
          will be installed or updated as part of this operation.

          With --be-name, rename the newly created boot environment to be the
          argument given.  This option is only valid if a new boot environment
          is created during image update.  See also beadm(1m).

          With --require-new-be, always create a new boot environment.  Without
          this option, a new boot environment is only created if needed.
          
          With --deny-new-be, disallow creation of a new boot environment;
          the operation will not be performed if a new boot environment is
          required.

     facet [-H] [<facet_spec> ...]
          Without arguments, displays the current values of all facets.  With
          argument(s), evaluate if each facet would be true or false and print
          the result.

          With -H, omit the headers from the listing.

     change-facet [-nvq] [--accept] [--be-name name] [--licenses]
       <facet_spec>=[True|False|None] ...

          Change the specified facets in the current image.

          With the -n option, plan the requested operation but make
          no actual changes.

          With the -v option, issue verbose progress messages during the
          requested operation.  With the -q option, be completely silent.

          With --accept, you indicate that you agree to and accept the
          terms of the licenses of the packages that are updated or
          installed.  If you do not provide this option, and any package
          licenses require acceptance, the operation will fail.

          With --licenses, display all of the licenses for the packages that
          will be installed or updated as part of this operation.

          With --be-name, rename the newly created boot environment to be the
          argument given.  This option is only valid if a new boot environment
          is created during the operation.  See also beadm(1m).

          With --require-new-be, always create a new boot environment.  Without
          this option, a new boot environment is only created if needed.
          
          With --deny-new-be, disallow creation of a new boot environment;
          the operation will not be performed if a new boot environment is
          required.

          Facets may be set to True or False.  Setting one to None removes
          that facet specification from the current image.

     fix [--accept] [--licenses] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]
          Fix any errors reported by pkg verify.  Please note that
          verification of installed package content is based on a
          custom content analysis that may return different results
          than those of other programs.

          With --accept, you indicate that you agree to and accept the
          terms of the licenses of the packages that are updated or

     set-property propname propvalue
          Update an existing image property or add a new image property;
          except for preferred-publisher, which can only be changed using
          set-publisher.

     add-property-value propname propvalue
          Add a value to an existing image property or add a new image property;
          except for preferred-publisher, which can only be changed using
          set-publisher.

     remove-property-value propname propvalue
          Remove a value from an existing image property; except for 
          preferred-publisher, which can only be changed using set-publisher.

     unset-property propname ...
          Remove an existing image property or properties; except for
          preferred-publisher, which can only be changed using
          set-publisher.

     property [-H] [propname ...]
          Display image property information.  With no argument, display the
          names and values for all image properties.  If a specific list of
          property names is requested, display the names and values for those
          properties.

          With -H, omit the headers from the listing.

       [--remove-property-value name_of_property=value_to_remove]
       [--unset-property name_of_property_to_delete]
       [publisher]

          Update an existing publisher or add an additional package
          publisher.  If no options affecting search order are specified,
          new publishers are appended to the search order and are thus
          searched last.

          With -P, set the specified publisher as the preferred
          publisher, i.e.  first in the search order.  When installing
          new packages, this publisher will be searched first.
          Updates to already installed packages will come from the
          same publisher that originally provided the package so long
          as that publisher remains sticky.

          With --non-sticky, specify that higher ranked publishers than
          this one may provide updates to packages originally installed
          from this publisher.

          With --sticky, return to the default behavior of always sourcing
          updates from the same publisher that provided the package originally.

          With --search-before, alter the publisher search order so that
          the publisher being modified is now searched before the specified
          publisher.

          With --search-after, alter the publisher search order so that
          the publisher being modified is now searched after the specified
          publisher.

          With --approve-ca-cert, add the given certificate as a CA certificate 
          that is trusted.  The hashes of the user approved CA certificates are
          listed in the output of the detailed pkg publisher view for a
          publisher.

          With --revoked-ca-cert, treat the certificate with the given hash as
          revoked.  The hashes of the user revoked CA certificates are
          listed in the output of the detailed pkg publisher view for a
          publisher.

          With --unset-ca-cert, remove the certificate with the given hash from
          the list of approved and the list of revoked certificates.

          With --set-property, update an existing publisher property or add a 
          new publisher property.

          With --add-property-value, add a value to an existing publisher 
          property or add a new publisher property.

          With --remove-property-value, remove a value from an existing 
          publisher property.

          With --unset-property, remove an existing publisher property.

          With -c and -k, specify client SSL certificate and key respectively.

          With -g (--add-origin), add the URI as an origin for the given
          publisher.  This should be the location of a package repository.

          With -G (--remove-origin), remove the URI from the list of origins
          for the given publisher.

          With --no-refresh, do not attempt to contact the publisher
          specified to retrieve its metadata (e.g. catalog).

          With --reset-uuid, choose a new unique identifier that identifies
          this image to its publisher.

          With -m (--add-mirror), add the URI as a mirror for the given
          publisher.

          With -M (--remove-mirror), remove the URI from the list of mirrors
          for the given publisher.

          With -p, retrieve publisher configuration information from the
          specified repository URI.  If a publisher is specified, then only
          the matching one will be added or updated.  If no publisher is
          specified, all will be added or updated as appropriate.  This option
          may not be combined with the -g, --add-origin, -G, --remove-origin,
          -m, --add-mirror, -M, --remove--mirror, --disable, --enable,
          --no-refresh, or --reset-uuid options.

          With -e (--enable), enable the publisher; with -d (--disable), disable
          the publisher.  A disabled publisher is not used when populating the
          package list or in certain package operations (install, uninstall, and
          update).  However, the properties for a disabled publisher can still
          be set and viewed.  If only one publisher exists, it cannot be
          disabled.

     unset-publisher publisher ...
          Remove the configuration associated with the given publisher
          or publishers.

     publisher [-HPn] [publisher ...]
          Display publisher information.  With no arguments, display
          the list of all publishers, their origin URIs, and mirrors
          in order of search preference.  If specific publishers are
          requested, display the configuration values, including
          mirrors, associated with those publishers.
          
          With -H, omit the headers from the listing.

          With -P, display only the preferred publisher.

          With -n, display only enabled publishers.

     history [-Hl] [-n number]
          Display the command history of the applicable image.  

          With -H, omit the headers from the listing.

          With -l, display log records in long format, which, in addition to
          the standard format, includes the outcome of the command, the time
          the command completed, the version and name of the client used, the
          name of the user who performed the operation, and any errors that
          were encountered while executing the command.

          With -n, display only the specified number of most recent entries.

     purge-history
          Deletes all existing history information.

     rebuild-index
          Rebuilds the index used by 'pkg search'.  This is a recovery operation
          not intended for general use.

     version
          Display a unique string identifying the version of pkg(1).  This
          string is not guaranteed to be comparable in any fashion between
          versions.

IMAGE PROPERTIES
     The following properties are part of the image and may be set using
     the set-property subcommand.  The values of these properties are
     viewable with the property subcommand.

     ca-path
          (string) A pathname that points to a directory where CA certs are
          kept for SSL operations.  The format of this directory is specific
          to the underlying SSL implementation.  If the administrator
          would like to use an alternate location for trusted CA
          certificates, this value should be changed to point to a
          different directory.  Please see the 'CApath' portions of
          SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3openssl) for requirements
          about the CA directory.

          Default value: /etc/openssl/certs

     flush-content-cache-on-success
          (boolean) If this is set to True, the package client will remove
          the files in its content-cache when install or update operations
          complete.  For update operations, the content is removed only
          from the source BE.  When a packaging operation next occurs in
          the destination BE, it will flush its content cache, provided
          this option has not been changed.

          This property may be used to keep the content-cache small on
          systems with limited disk space, but it may cause operations
          to take longer to complete.

          Default value: False

     mirror-discovery
          (boolean)  Mirror-discovery tells the client to discover
          link-local content mirrors using mDNS and DNS-SD.  If this is
          set to True, the client will attempt to download package content
          from mirrors it dynamically discovers.  To run a mirror that
          advertises its content via mDNS, see pkg.depotd(1m).

          Default value: False

     send-uuid
          (boolean)  Send the image's Universally Unique Identifier
          (UUID) when performing network operations.  Although users may
          disable this option, some network repositories may refuse to talk
          to clients that do not supply a UUID.

          Default value: True

     signature-policy
          (string)  Determine what checks will be performed on manifests
          when installing a package into this image.  The final policy 
          applied to a  package depends on the combination of image policy 
          and publisher policy.  The combination will be at least as strict 
          as the stricter of the two policies taken individually.  The 
          following are the valid values for this property.

          ignore
               Ignore signatures for all manifests.
          verify
               Verify that all manifests with signatures are validly
               signed, but do not require all installed packages to be 
               signed.
          require-signatures
               Require that all newly installed packages have at least
               one valid signature.  'pkg fix' and 'pkg verify' will also
               warn if an installed package does not have a valid 
               signature.
          require-names
               Follow the same requirements as 'require-signatures' but
               also require that the strings listed in the 
               'signature-required-names' property appear as a common
               name of the certificates used to verifiy the chains
               of trust of the signatures.

     signature-required-names
          (list of strings)  A list of names which must be seen as common
          names of certificates while validating the signatures of a 
          package.

     trust-anchor-directory
          (string)  The pathname of the directory that contains the trust 
          anchors for the image.  This path is relative to the image.

PUBLISHER PROPERTIES
     The following properties are part of the image and may be set using
     the set-property option of the set-publisher subcommand.

     signature-policy
          (string)  This property functions identically to the image
          property of the same name except it only applies to packages
          from the particular publisher.

     signature-required-names
          (list of strings)  This property functions identically to the 
          image property of the same name except it only applies to 
          packages from the particular publisher.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1:  Create a new, full image, with publisher example.com,
     stored at /aux0/example_root.

     $ pkg image-create -F -p example.com=http://pkg.example.com:10000 \
          /aux0/example_root

     Example 2:  Create a new, full image, with publisher example.com,
     that also has an additional mirror, two additional origins and is
     stored at /aux0/example_root.

     $ pkg image-create -F -p example.com=http://pkg.example.com:10000 \
          -g http://alternate1.example.com:10000/ \
          -g http://alternate2.example.com:10000/ \
          -m http://mirror.example.com:10000/ \
          /aux0/example_root

     Example 3:  Install the latest version of the widget package in the
     current image.

     $ pkg install application/widget

     Example 4:  List the contents of the SUNWzfs package.  Display the
     action name, the mode of the file (if defined), the size (if defined),
     the path, and the target (if a link).  Limit the action to types dir,
     file, link, and hardlink, since specifying the action.name attribute,
     which is available for all actions, will display a line for all
     actions, which is not desired here.

     $ pkg contents -t dir,file,link,hardlink \
          -o action.name,mode,pkg.size,path,target SUNWzfs
     NAME  MODE   SIZE PATH                                TARGET

     Example 5:  List the contents of SUNWfirefox and SUNWthunderbird,
     limiting the display to just the package name and path attributes of
     actions whose "path" attribute ends in ".desktop" or ".png".

     $ pkg contents contents -o pkg.name,path -a path=\*.desktop \
         -a path=\*.png SUNWfirefox SUNWthunderbird
     PKG.NAME        PATH
     SUNWfirefox     usr/lib/firefox/chrome/icons/default/default16.png
     SUNWfirefox     usr/lib/firefox/chrome/icons/default/default32.png
     SUNWfirefox     usr/lib/firefox/chrome/icons/default/default48.png
     SUNWfirefox     usr/lib/firefox/icons/document.png
     SUNWfirefox     usr/lib/firefox/icons/mozicon128.png
     SUNWfirefox     usr/lib/firefox/res/html/folder.png
     SUNWfirefox     usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop
     SUNWthunderbird usr/share/applications/thunderbird.desktop
     SUNWfirefox     usr/share/pixmaps/firefox-icon.png
     SUNWthunderbird usr/share/pixmaps/thunderbird-icon.png

     Example 6:  Search the package database for the token "bge".

     $ pkg search bge
     INDEX       ACTION VALUE                   PACKAGE
     basename    file   kernel/drv/bge          pkg:/SUNWbge@0.5.11-0.79
     driver_name driver bge                     pkg:/SUNWbge@0.5.11-0.79

     The token shows up in the package SUNWbge both as the basename for the
     file action representing /kernel/drv/bge and as a driver name.

     Example 7: Search for installed packages which depend on SUNWipkg.

     $ pkg search -l 'depend::SUNWipkg'
     INDEX       ACTION VALUE                   PACKAGE
     incorporate depend SUNWipkg@0.5.11-0.111   pkg:/entire@0.5.11-0.111
     require     depend SUNWipkg@0.5.11-0.111   pkg:/slim_install@0.1-0.111
     require     depend SUNWipkg@0.5.11-0.111   pkg:/SUNWipkg-brand@0.5.11-0.111

     Example 8: Search for all incorporate dependencies in installed packages.

     $ pkg search -l 'depend:incorporate:'
     INDEX       ACTION VALUE                   PACKAGE
     incorporate depend BRCMbnx@0.5.11-0.111    pkg:/entire@0.5.11-0.111
     incorporate depend BRCMbnx@0.5.11-0.111    pkg:/entire@0.5.11-0.111
     ....

     Example 9:  Add new publisher example.org, with a repository located at
     http://www.example.org/repo:

     $ pkg set-publisher -g http://www.example.org/repo example.org

     Example 10:  Add new publisher example.com, with a secure repository
     located at https://secure.example.com/repo, and a key and cert stored
     in the directory /root/creds:

     $ pkg set-publisher -k /root/creds/example.key \
          -c /root/creds/example.cert -g https://secure.example.com/repo \
          example.com

     Example 11:  Add new publisher with a repository located at
     /export/repo using automatic configuration:

     $ pkg set-publisher -p file:/export/repo

     Example 12:  Add new publisher example.org with a repository located
     at /export/repo/example.com using manual configuration:

     $ pkg set-publisher -g file:/export/repo example.com

     Example 13:  Configure an image to verify all signed packages.

     $ pkg set-property signature-policy verify

     Example 14:  Configure an image to require all packages to be signed and
     the string "opensolaris.org" has to be seen as a common name for one of
     the certificates in the chain of trust.

     $ pkg set-property signature-policy require-names opensolaris.org

     Example 15:  Configure an image so that all packages installed from
     publisher foo must be signed.

     $ pkg set-publisher --set-property signature-policy=require-signatures

     Example 16:  Add the string "foo" to the image's list of common names that 
     must be seen in a signature's chain of trust to be considered valid.

     $ pkg add-property-value signature-require-names foo

     Example 17:  Remove the string "foo" from publisher test's list of common
     names that must be seen to validate a signature.

     $ pkg set-publisher --remove-property-value signature-require-names=foo \
         test

     Example 18:  Add the certificate stored in /tmp/example_file.pem as a
     trusted CA certificate for the publisher test.

     $ pkg set-publisher --approve-ca-cert /tmp/example_file.pem

     Example 19:  Revoke the certificate with the hash a12345 for publisher 
     test, preventing it from validating any signatures for packages from test.

     $ pkg set-publisher --revoke-ca-cert a12345

     Example 20:  Make pkg forget that the certificate a12345 was ever added or
     revoked by the user.

     $ pkg set-publisher --unset-ca-cert a12345

     Example 21:  Downgrade the installed package foo@1.1 to an older
     version:

     $ pkg update foo@1.0

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Command succeeded.

     1     An error occurred.

     2     Invalid command line options were specified.

     3     Multiple operations were requested, but only some of them
           succeeded.

     4     No changes were made - nothing to do.

     5     The requested operation cannot be performed on a live
           image.

     6     The requested operation cannot be completed as the licenses
           for the packages being installed or updated have not been
           accepted.

     7     The image is currently in use by another process and cannot
           be modified.

FILES
     A pkg(5) image can be located arbitrarily within a larger file
     system.  In the following, the token $IMAGE_ROOT is used to
     distinguish relative paths.  For a typical system installation,
     $IMAGE_ROOT is equivalent to "/".

     $IMAGE_ROOT/var/pkg        Metadata directory for a full or partial
                                image.

     $IMAGE_ROOT/.org.opensolaris,pkg
                                Metadata directory for a user image.

     Within a particular image's metadata, certain files and directories
     can contain information useful during repair and recovery.  We use
     the token $IMAGE_META to refer to the top-level directory
     containing the metadata.  $IMAGE_META is typically one of the two
     paths given above.

     $IMAGE_META/lost+found     Location of conflicting directories and
                                files moved during a package operation.

     $IMAGE_META/publisher      Contains a directory for each publisher.
                                Each directory stores publisher-specific
                                metadata.

     Other paths within the $IMAGE_META directory hierarchy are Private,
     and are subject to change.

NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all subject
     to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris community
     at:

     http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+pkg/

     At present, user images are not restricted to relocatable
     packages--but they will be.

     The pkg(1) command recognizes use of the http_proxy and https_proxy
     environment variables to select a suitable HTTP or HTTPS proxy
     server.  At present, particular care is needed when using local
     repository URIs--such as http://localhost:10000/--with the
     http_proxy environment variable; this behavior may change in a
     future version of image packaging.

     At present, pkg(1), on directory removal, will move unpackaged
     contents of that directory to $IMAGE_META/lost+found.
