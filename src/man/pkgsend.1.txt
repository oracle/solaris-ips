DESCRIPTION
     pkgsend allows the publication of new packages and new package
     versions to an image packaging repository.  Each publication is
     structured as a transaction; multiple invocations of pkgsend
     through a transaction allow the addition of resources and the
     transaction submission.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -s repo_uri    A URI representing the location of the target
                    repository.  Both HTTP and filesystem-based
                    publication are supported. The default value is
                    http://localhost:10000/.

                    For filesystem-based publication, the repo_uri
                    should be specified as follows:

                      file://<absolute_path_to_repository>

                    See the NOTES section below for more information
                    about restrictions or suggestions for publication.

     --help or -?
          Displays a usage message.

SUBCOMMANDS
     The following subcommands are supported:

     create-repository
          Creates a new repository at the provided location if it does
          not already exist.  Only supported for 'file://' repository
          locations at this time.

          Initial repository configuration values can be provided
          using the --set-property option.  It may also be specified
          multiple times.  See pkg.depotd(1M) for a full list of
          repository properties.

     open [-en] pkg_fmri
          Begin a transaction on the package and version specified by
          pkg_fmri.

          By default, or if the -e option is given, a successfully
          opened transaction's ID will be published in a form suitable
          for use with eval(1), to set the PKG_TRANS_ID environment
          variable.  This form can be convenient for delivering a
          package transaction from a shell script, for example.  If the
          -n option is given, the transaction ID is displayed as a
          string; this may be more useful in situations where shell
          scripting is not an available option.

     add action arguments
          Add a resource associated with an action to the current
          transaction.  Requires transaction context.  See ACTIONS
          below.

     import [-T pattern] [--target file] bundlefile ...
          Add each given bundlefile into the current transaction.
          Supported bundle types are:

            - filesystem format SVr4 packages
            - datastream format SVr4 packages
            - tar files
            - directories

          If the basename of files in the bundle match the pattern(s)
          specified with -T, the timestamp of the file is added to the
          action for that file.  The pattern uses shell matching rules:

               *      matches everything
               ?      matches any single character
               [seq]  matches any character in seq
               [!seq] matches any character not in seq

          When the bundle is a directory, there is no clear way to
          distinguish a file action from a hardlink action when there are
          multiple pathnames for a single inode.  Normally, the first one
          found in the filesystem walk is treated as a file and the rest as
          hardlinks.  This may be arbitrary, depending on the
          implementation of the filesystem.  To specify which pathnames
          should be treated as files, pass each pathname as an argument to
          the --target option.  This option has no effect on other bundle
          types, as they are capable of expressing which pathnames are
          files and which are hardlinks.

     include [-d basedir] ... [manifest] ...
          Add resources associated with the multiple actions present in
          each manifest file to the current transaction.  If no files
          are specified, the standard input is read.  Each line in the
          file should be the string representation of an action.  In
          particular, the "add" token as described above should not be
          present, nor should there be open and close tokens representing
          transaction boundaries.  For those actions with datastreams, the
          path to the file containing the data should be the second word on
          the line; for file actions if this is set to "NOHASH" the value of
          the "path" attribute is used instead.

          If the user specifies the -d option, basedir is prepended to
          the search path when locating files in the manifest.  Multiple
          -d options have their directories searched in the order they
          appear on the command line.

     close [-A] [--no-index]
          Close current transaction.  With -A, abandon the current
          transaction.  With --no-index, do not update the
          repository's search indices.  With --no-catalog, do not add
          to catalog which for now is only effective with file:// scheme
          repositories.  This improves performance when publishing
          many packages at once; the repository will need to be
          started with a --add-content flag (see pkg.depotd(1M) man
          page) to catalog and index the new content.

     publish [ -d basedir] ... [--no-index] [--fmri-in-manifest | fmri]
          [--no-catalog] [manifest] ...

          Combines open, include and close in a single operation.  -d
          and --no-index options behave as described for include and
          close subcommands.  With --fmri-in-manifest, use the fmri
          specified in the package manifest w/ a set action name of
          "pkg.fmri".  Otherwise the fmri must be specified on the
          command line.  With --no-catalog (which has effect only w/
          file:// scheme repositories), do not update the catalog with
          the new package.  This improves performance when publishing
          many packages at once; the repository will need to be started
          with a --add-content flag (see pkg.depotd(1M) man page) to
          catalog and index the new content.

     generate [-T pattern] [--target file] bundlefile ...
          Read each given bundlefile (such as an SVR4 package, directory,
          tarfile, etc) and emit the manifest describing the bundlefile to
          the stdout.  The -T and --target options work as in the import
          command.  The repo argument or PKG_TRANS_ID is not used with this
          subcommand.  Once obtained, the manifest can be annotated, have
          dependencies analyzed, added, etc before being passed to the
          publish or import subcommands.

     refresh-index
          Update the repository's search indices.  Should be used after
          closing one or more transactions using --no-index.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     The following environment variables are supported:

     PKG_TRANS_ID               Identifier to use for this transaction.
                                If undefined (and no alternative means
                                of specifying a transaction is given),
                                subcommands requiring transaction
                                context will fail.

ACTIONS
     Each resource within a package must be associated with an action.
     See pkg(5) for a complete list of actions.

     If an action has an associated payload, the path to the payload
     must be the first argument after the action name.  (At present, the
     file and license actions have payloads.)  All other attributes are
     specified as a list of name-value pairs, and may be given in any
     order.  An action must always have a key attribute; however, some
     actions may require additional attributes to work correctly.
     Arbitrary attributes, beyond those defined for a given action, may
     be included in the action.  Such attributes are expected to follow
     defined conventions such that they carry appropriate meaning or
     avoid collision with attributes from other action providers;
     specific attributes that cause additional operations, known as
     "actuators", are documented in pkg(5).

     depend type=<depend_type> fmri=<pkg_fmri> [ property_list ]
          Make this package version dependent on the give package FMRI.
          Valid depend_types are require and optional.

     dir mode=<mode> owner=<userid> group=<groupid> path=<path> \
       [ property_list ]
          Deliver a directory with the listed attributes into the
          transaction.

     driver name=<name> perms=<perms> class=<class> alias=<alias> \
       [ property_list ]
          Deliver driver configuration with the listed attributes into
          the transaction.  Multiple alias entries may be given to
          record multiple device aliases.

     file src_path mode=<mode> owner=<userid> group=<groupid> \
        path=<path> [ property_list ]
          Deliver a file with the listed attributes into the
          transaction.

     group groupname=<groupname> gid=<gid> [ property_list ]
          Deliver a group definition as defined in group(4).  If the
          group ID, or gid, is omitted, the first free group under 100
          will be assigned at installation time.  See pkg(5) for
          additional details, and relation to the user action below.

     hardlink path=<path> target=<target> [ property_list ]
          Deliver a link with given path, pointing to the given
          target.

     legacy category=<category> desc=<description> hotline=<hotline> \
       name=<name> pkg=<legacy_pkg> vendor=<vendor> version=<version> \
       [ property_list ]
          Deliver sufficient metadata, as given by the various fields,
          to represent a System V package with name given by legacy_pkg.

     license src_path license=<license_name> \
       [ property_list ]
          Deliver, into the image packaging metadata, the license file
          at src_path, labeled by the given license value.

     link path=<path> target=<target> [ property_list ]
          Deliver a symbolic link with given path, pointing to the given
          target.

     set name=<name> value=<value> [ property_list ]
          Deliver a "package property" defined by the given name and
          value.

     user username=<username> password=<password> uid=<uid> \
       group=<group> gcos-field=<gcos> home-dir=<homedir> \
       login-shell=<login-shell> group-list=<group> \
       [ group-list=<group> ... ] ftpuser={true|false} \
       lastchng=<lastchange> min=<mindays> max=<maxdays> \
       warn=<warndays> inactive=<inactivedays> expire=<expiredate> \
       flag=<flag> [ property_list ]
          Deliver a user account, as defined in passwd(4), shadow(4),
          group(4), and ftpusers(4).  If the user ID, or uid, is
          omitted, then the first free user ID under 100 will be
          assigned at installation time.  The primary group, specified
          by group, must exist prior to the action's execution; this
          condition can be ensured by having a group action deliver the
          group definition in the same package as the user action, or by
          having a depend action that expresses a requirement on a
          package possessing a group action.  The group-list property
          delivers one group to the group(4) entry for the specified
          user.  Multiple groups are delivered by multiple assignments
          to group-list.  See pkg(5) for additional details.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1:  Create a trivial package.

     $ eval `pkgsend open example@1.0-1`
     $ pkgsend add file example mode=0555 owner=root group=bin \
         path=/usr/bin/example
     $ pkgsend close

     Example 2:  Create a new repository suitable for use with pkgsend
         or with a pkg(5) depot server.

     $ pkgsend -s file:///tmp/example_repo create-repository \
         --set-property publisher.prefix=opensolaris.org

     Example 3:  Publish a package using filesystem-based publication
         and a pre-existing manifest:

     $ pkgsend -s file:///tmp/example_repo -d /tmp/pkg_files \
         /tmp/pkg_manifest

     Example 4:  Create a package that delivers two groups and a user.

     $ eval `pkgsend open groups-and-user@1.0-1`
     $ pkgsend add group groupname=maingrp
     $ pkgsend add group groupname=auxgrp
     $ pkgsend add user ftpuser=false gcos-field="Example User" \
          group=maingrp group-list=auxgrp password=NP username=exuser
     $ pkgsend close

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Command succeeded.

     1     An error occurred.

     2     Invalid command line options were specified.

NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all subject
     to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris community
     at:

     http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+pkg/

     Other package bundle formats can be created.  Other forms of package
     publication, via the underlying Python API or via the web API, are
     also possible.

     When publishing individual package files that are greater than 128MB
     in size, filesystem-based publication must be used due to publication
     protocol limitations.  It is also the recommended method of publication
     when access control for a repository is needed.

     When using filesystem-based publication, any pkg.depot(1M) processes
     serving the target repository must be restarted after publication is
     completed for the changes to be reflected in its web interface or
     search responses.  See pkg.depotd(1M) for more information.
