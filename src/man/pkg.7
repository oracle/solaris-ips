<refsect1 id="GLHDA" role="description"><title></title>
<para>The image packaging system, <literal>pkg</literal>(7), is a framework
that provides for software lifecycle management (installation, upgrade, and
removal). Image packaging manages software in units of packages, which are
collections of actions, defined by a set of key/value pairs and possibly a
data payload. In many cases, actions are files found in a file system, but
they also represent other installable objects, such as drivers, services,
and users.</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1 role="other"><title>Package FMRIs and Versions</title>
<para>Each package is represented by a fault management resource identifier
(FMRI) with the scheme <literal>pkg:</literal>. The full FMRI for a package
consists of the scheme, a publisher, the package name, and a version string
in the following format:</para>
<screen>pkg://solaris/system/library/c++-runtime@0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1:20120921T190358Z
</screen>
<para><literal>solaris</literal> is the publisher. <literal>system/library/c++-runtime
</literal> is the package name. Although the namespace is hierarchical and
arbitrarily deep, there is no enforced containment; the name is essentially
arbitrary. The publisher information is optional, but must be preceded by <literal>
pkg://</literal> if present. An FMRI that includes the publisher is often
referred to as being &ldquo;fully qualified.&rdquo; If publisher information
is not present, then the package name should generally be preceded by <literal>pkg:/
</literal>.</para>
<para>Packaging clients often allow the scheme of an FMRI to be omitted if
it does not contain publisher information. For example, <literal>pkg:/system/library/c++-runtime
</literal> can be written as <literal>system/library/c++-runtime</literal>.
If the scheme is omitted, clients also allow omission of all but the last
component of a package name for matching purposes. For example, <literal>system/library/c++-runtime
</literal> could be written as <literal>library/c++-runtime</literal> or <literal>
c++-runtime</literal>, which would then match packages named <literal>c++-runtime
</literal> or package names ending in <literal>/c++-runtime</literal>.</para>
<para>A publisher name identifies a person, group of persons, or an organization
as the source of one or more packages. To avoid publisher name collisions
and help identify the publisher, a best practice is to use a domain name that
represents the entity publishing the packages as a publisher name.</para>
<para>The version follows the package name, separated by an at sign (@). The
version consists of four sequences of numbers, separated by punctuation. The
elements in the first three sequences are separated by dots, and the sequences
are arbitrarily long. Leading zeros in version components (for example, 01.1
or 1.01) are not permitted. Trailing zeros (for example, 1.10) are permitted.</para>
<para>The first part of the version is the component version. For components
tightly bound to the operating system, this is usually the value of
<command>uname -r</command> for that version of the operating system. For a
component with its own development lifecycle, this sequence is a dotted
release number, such as 2.4.10.</para>
<para>The second part of the version, which if present must follow a comma
(,), is the build version. The build version specifies what version of the
operating system the contents of the package were built on, providing a minimum
bound on which operating system version the contents can be expected to run
successfully.</para>
<para>The third part of the version, which if present must follow a hyphen
(<literal>-</literal>), is the branch version. The branch version is a versioning
component that provides vendor-specific information. The branch version can
be incremented when the packaging metadata is changed, independently of the
component version. The branch version might contain a build number or other
information.</para>
<para>The fourth part of the version, which if present must follow a colon
(:), is a timestamp. The timestamp represents when the package was published.</para>
<para>When performing comparisons between versions, no component of the full
version is considered unless the components to its left are the same. Thus, <literal>
4.3-1</literal> is greater than <literal>4.2-7</literal> because <literal>4.3</literal> is
greater than <literal>4.2</literal>, and <literal>4.3-3</literal> is greater
than <literal>4.3-1</literal> because <literal>3</literal> is greater than <literal>
1</literal>.</para>
<para>The <literal>pkg.human-version</literal> attribute can be used to provide
a human-readable version string. The value of the
<literal>pkg.human-version</literal> attribute can be provided in addition to
the package version described above for the package FMRI but cannot replace the
package FMRI version. The human-readable version string is only used for
display purposes. See &ldquo;Set Actions&rdquo; for more information.</para>
<para>Many parts of the system, when appropriate, abridge FMRIs when displaying
them, and accept input in shorter forms to reduce the volume of information
displayed or required. Typically, the scheme, publisher, build version, and
timestamp can be elided. Sometimes all of the versioning information can be
omitted.</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1 role="other"><title>Actions</title>
<para>Actions represent the installable objects on a system. Actions are described
in the manifest of a package. Every action consists primarily of its name
and a key attribute. Together, these refer to a unique object as it follows
a version history. Actions can have other attributes. Some attributes are
interpreted directly by the packaging system. Other attributes might be useful
only to the system administrator or the end-user.</para>
<para>Actions have a simple text representation:</para>
<programlisting><replaceable>action_name</replaceable> <replaceable>attribute1</replaceable>=<replaceable>
value1</replaceable> <replaceable>attribute2</replaceable>=<replaceable>value2</replaceable> ...
</programlisting>
<para>Names of attributes cannot have whitespace, quotation marks, or equals
signs (=) in them. All characters after the first equals sign belong to the
value. Values can have all of those, though spaces must be enclosed in single
or double quotation marks. Single quotation marks do not need to be escaped
inside a string that is enclosed in double quotation marks, and double quotation
marks do not need to be escaped inside a string that is enclosed in single
quotation marks. A quotation mark can be prefixed with a backslash (&bsol;)
character to avoid terminating the quoted string. A backslash can be escaped
with a backslash.</para>
<para>Actions can have multiple attributes. Some attributes can be named multiple
times with different values for a single action. Multiple attributes with
the same name are treated as unordered lists.</para>
<para>Actions with many attributes can create long lines in a manifest file.
Such lines can be wrapped by terminating each incomplete line with a backslash.
Note that this continuation character must occur between attribute/value pairs.
Neither attributes nor their values nor the combination can be split.</para>
<para>The attributes listed below are not an exhaustive set. In fact, the
attributes that can be attached to an action are arbitrary, and the standard
sets of attributes are easy to augment to incorporate future developments.</para>
<para>Some attributes cause additional operations to be executed outside of
the packaging context. These attributes are documented in the &ldquo;Actuators&rdquo;
section below.</para>
<para>Actions that are installed to a path must not deliver content to any of
the following paths:</para>
<programlisting>/system/volatile
/tmp
/var/share
/var/tmp</programlisting>
<para>Additionallly, the following directories are reserved for use by the system
and should also not be used by actions:</para>
<programlisting>/var/pkg</programlisting>
<refsect2><title>File Actions</title>
<para>The <literal>file</literal> action represents an ordinary file. The <literal>
file</literal> action references a payload, and has four standard attributes:</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><literal>path</literal></term>
<listitem><para>The file system path where the file is installed. This is
a <literal>file</literal> action's key attribute.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><literal>mode</literal></term>
<listitem><para>The access permissions (in numeric form) of the file. These
are simple permissions only, not ACLs.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><literal>owner</literal></term>
<listitem><para>The name of the user that owns the file.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><literal>group</literal></term>
<listitem><para>The name of the group that owns the file.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>The payload is a positional attribute in that it is not named. It is
the first word after the action name. In a published manifest, it is the <literal>
SHA-1</literal> hash of the file contents. If present in a manifest that has
yet to be published, it represents the path where the payload can be found.
See <command>pkgsend</command>(1). The hash attribute can be used instead
of the positional attribute, should the value include an equals sign. Both
can be used in the same action. However, the hashes must be identical.</para>
<para>The <literal>preserve</literal> and <literal>overlay</literal> attributes
affect whether and how a <literal>file</literal> action is installed.</para>
<variablelist termlength="wholeline">
<varlistentry><term><literal>preserve</literal></term>

<refsect1 role="other"><title>Constraints and Freezing</title>
<para>When a package is transitioned to a new version, or when it is added
to or removed from the system, the version that is chosen, or whether removal
is allowed, is determined by a variety of constraints put on the package.
Those constraints can be defined by other packages in the form of dependencies,
or by the administrator in the form of freezes.</para>
<para>The most common form of constraint is delivered by the <literal>require</literal> dependency,
as described in &ldquo;Depend Actions&rdquo; above. Such a constraint prevents
the package from being downgraded or removed.</para>
<para>Most parts of the operating system are encapsulated by packages called <emphasis>
incorporations</emphasis>. These packages primarily deliver constraints represented
by the <literal>incorporate</literal> dependency.</para>
<para>As described above, an incorporated package need not be present on the
system, but if it is, then it specifies both an inclusive minimum version
and an exclusive maximum version. For example, if the dependent FMRI has a
version of 1.4.3, then no version less than 1.4.3 would satisfy the dependency,
and neither would any version greater than or equal to 1.4.4. However, versions
that merely extended the dotted sequence, such as 1.4.3.7, would be allowed.</para>
<para>Incorporations are used to force parts of the system to upgrade synchronously.
For some components, such as the C library and the kernel, this is a basic
requirement. For others, such as a simple userland component on which nothing
else has a dependency, the synchronous upgrade is used merely to provide a
known and tested set of package versions that can be referred to by a particular
version of the incorporation.</para>
<para>Since an incorporation is simply a package, it can be removed, and all
the constraints it delivers are therefore relaxed. However, many of the incorporations
delivered by Oracle Solaris are required by the packages they incorporate
because that relaxation would not be safe.</para>
<para>Attempting an upgrade of a package to a version that is not allowed
by an installed incorporation will not attempt to find a newer version of
the incorporation in order to satisfy the request, but will instead fail.
If the constraint itself must be moved, and the incorporation specifying it
cannot be removed, then the incorporation must be upgraded to a version that
specifies a desired version of the constraint. Upgrading an incorporation
causes all of the incorporated packages that would not satisfy the constraints
delivered by the new version to be upgraded as well.</para>
<para>A system administrator can constrain a package by using the
<command>pkg freeze</command> command. The named package is constrained to the version
installed on the system if no version is provided. If a versioned package
is provided, then this administrative constraint, or freeze, acts as if an
incorporate dependency were installed where the <literal>fmri</literal> attribute
had the value of the provided package version.</para>
<para>A freeze is never lifted automatically by the packaging system. To relax
a constraint, use the <command>pkg unfreeze</command> command.</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1 role="other"><title>Publishers and Repositories</title>
<para>As detailed above, a publisher is simply a name that package clients
use to identify the provider of packages. Publishers can distribute their
packages using package repositories and/or package archives. There are two
types of repositories currently supported by the package system: origin repositories
and mirror repositories.</para>
<para>An <emphasis>origin</emphasis> is a package repository that contains
all of the metadata (such as catalogs, manifests, and search indexes) and
content (files) for one or more packages. If multiple origins are configured
for a given publisher in an image, the package client API attempts to choose
the best origin to retrieve package data from. This is the most common type
of repository, and is implicitly created whenever <command>pkgsend</command> or <command>
pkgrecv</command> is used on a package repository.</para>
<para>A <emphasis>mirror</emphasis> is a package repository that contains
only package content (files). If one or more mirrors are configured for a
given publisher in an image, the client API prefers the mirrors for package
content retrieval and attempts to choose the best one to retrieve package
content from. If the mirror is unreachable, does not have the required content,
or is slower, the client API retrieves the content from any configured origin
repositories. Mirrors are intended for content sharing among a trusted set
of clients using the dynamic mirror functionality of <command>pkg.depotd</command>(8).
Mirrors are also intended to be used to authenticate access to package metadata,
but distribute the package content without authentication. For example, a
client might be configured with an <literal>https</literal> origin that requires
an SSL key and certificate pair to access, and with an <literal>http</literal> mirror
that provides the package content. In this way, only authorized clients can
install or update the packages, while the overhead of authentication for package
content retrieval is avoided. A mirror can be created by removing all subdirectories
of a repository except those named <filename>file</filename> and their parents.
An origin repository can be also be provisioned as a mirror by using the mirror
mode of <command>pkg.depotd</command>(8).</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1 role="other"><title>Global and Non-Global Zone Update</title>
<para>The <literal>pkg</literal> system forces non-global zones to be kept
in sync with the global zone. This means that certain packages must be at
the same version in the global zone and all non-global zones to ensure the
same kernel is run. To do this, <literal>pkg</literal> uses <literal>parent</literal> dependencies
to impose certain constraints on non-global zones. See &ldquo;Depend Actions&rdquo;
above for more information about <literal>parent</literal> dependencies.</para>
<para>Because of restrictions that the global zone imposes on non-global zones,
the non-global zones must have access to the packages of the global zone and
must have a similar publisher configuration. Both of these objectives are
achieved by using a <emphasis role="strong">system repository</emphasis> (see
the <literal>pkg.sysrepo</literal>(8) man page). The system repository provides
access to the publishers configured in the global zone and information about
how those publishers are configured. To prevent non-global zones from choosing
different packages during installation or update, system publishers are ranked
higher in the publisher search order than publishers configured in the non-global
zone. See the <command>pkg set-publisher</command> command in the <literal>pkg</literal>(1)
man page for information about publisher search order.</para>
<para>To update all non-global zones on the system, use the <command>pkg update</command> command
with no arguments in the global zone. This command operates on the global
zone and on each non-global zone recursively. The minimal changes necessary
are made to non-global zones to bring them in sync with the changes made in
the global zone. For example, suppose package <literal>foo</literal> is installed
at version 1 in both the global zone and non-global zones, and suppose version
2 is available in a system repository. If <literal>foo</literal> has a parent
dependency, then <command>pkg update foo</command> updates <literal>foo</literal> to
version 2 in both the global zone and the non-global zones because the <literal>parent
</literal> dependency forces the package to stay in sync. If <literal>foo</literal> does
not have a parent dependency, then <literal>foo</literal> is updated to version
2 in the global zone but remains at version 1 in the non-global zones.</para>

<refsect1 role="other"><title>Facets and Variants</title>
<para>Software can have components that are optional and components that are
mutually exclusive. Examples of optional components include locales and documentation.
Examples of mutually exclusive components include SPARC or x86 and debug or
non-debug binaries.</para>
<para>In IPS, optional components are called <emphasis>facets</emphasis> and
mutually exclusive components are called <emphasis>variants</emphasis>. Facets
and variants are specified as tags on package actions. Each facet and variant
tag has a name and a value. A single action can have multiple facet and variant
tags. Examples of components with multiple facet and variant tags include
an architecture-specific header file that is used by developers, or a component
that is only for a SPARC global zone.</para>
<para>An example of a variant tag is <literal>variant.arch=sparc</literal>.
An example of a facet tag is <literal>facet.devel=true</literal>. Facets and
variants are often referred to without the leading <literal>facet.</literal> and <literal>
variant.</literal>.</para>
<para>Facets and variants are special properties of the image and cannot be
set on individual packages. To view the current values of the facets and variants
set on the image, use the <command>pkg facet</command> and <command>pkg variant</command> commands
as shown in the <command>pkg</command>(1) man page. To modify the values of
the facets and variants set on the image, use the <command>pkg change-facet</command> and <command>
pkg change-variant</command> commands.</para>
<para>Facets are treated as boolean values by package clients: Facets can
be set only to <literal>true</literal> (enabled) or <literal>false</literal> (disabled)
in the image. By default, all facets starting with 'facet.debug.' or 'facet.optional.' are considered
to be set to <literal>false</literal> in the image; all others are considered to be set to <literal>true</literal>
in the image.</para>
<para>Facets can be either set locally within an image using the <command>pkg change-facet</command> command or inherited from a parent image. For
example, a non-global zone can inherit a facet from the global zone. Inherited facets are evaluated
before, and take priority over, any locally set facets. If the same facet is both inherited and
locally set, the inherited facet value masks the locally set value. Masked facets have no effect on facet evaluation and package actions. Facet changes made by using the
<command>pkg change-facet</command> command only affect locally set facets. Inherited facets can only be changed by making the change in the parent image. By default, the <command>pkg facet</command> command does not display masked facets.</para>
<para>The value of a facet tag on an action can be set to <literal>all</literal> or
<literal>true</literal> to control how clients filter faceted actions. All values other than
<literal>all</literal> or <literal>true</literal> have undefined behavior. See below for a
description of the conditions that must exist in the image to install an action that has facet
tags.</para>
<para>The <literal>all</literal> value for a facet is useful when more than
a single level of filtering is required. In the following example, <literal>foo.txt
</literal> is installed only if the <literal>doc</literal> facet and at least
one of the <literal>locale</literal> facets is <literal>true</literal> in
the image. This enables administrators to exclude documentation, but still
enable or disable support for specific locales. In addition, <literal>api.txt</literal> is
only installed if both the <literal>doc</literal> and <literal>devel</literal> facets
are <literal>true</literal> in the image.</para>
<programlisting>file path=usr/share/doc/foo/foo.txt facet.doc=all facet.locale.en_GB=true facet.locale.en_US=true
file path=usr/share/doc/foo/api.txt facet.doc=all facet.devel=all</programlisting>
<para>A facet set on the image can be a full facet such as <literal>doc.man</literal> or
a pattern such as <literal>locale.*</literal>. This is useful when you want
to disable a portion of the facet namespace, and only enable individual facets
within it. For example, you could disable all locales and then only enable
one or two specific locales, as shown in the following example:</para>
<screen># <userinput>pkg change-facet locale.*=false</userinput>
[output about packages being updated]
# <userinput>pkg change-facet locale.en_US=true</userinput>
[output about packages being updated]</screen>
<para>Most variants can have any number of values. For example, the
<literal>arch</literal> variant can be set to <literal>i386</literal>,
<literal>sparc</literal>, <literal>ppc</literal>, <literal>arm</literal>, or
whatever architectures the distribution
supports. (Only <literal>i386</literal> and <literal>sparc</literal> are used
in Oracle Solaris.) The exception are the <literal>debug</literal> variants.
The <literal>debug</literal> variants should only be set to <literal>true</literal>
or <literal>false</literal>; other values have undefined behavior. If a file
action has both non-debug and debug versions, both versions must have the
applicable <literal>debug</literal> variant explicitly set, as shown in the
following example:</para>
<programlisting>file group=sys mode=0644 overlay=allow owner=root &bsol;
  path=etc/motd pkg.csize=115 pkg.size=103 preserve=true &bsol;
  variant.debug.osnet=true

file group=sys mode=0644 overlay=allow owner=root &bsol;
  path=etc/motd pkg.csize=68 pkg.size=48 preserve=true &bsol;
  variant.debug.osnet=false</programlisting>
<para>The variant value must be set on the image in order for a package using
the variant to be installed; by default all unspecified variants have the value
'false', which may or may not make the package installable. The
<literal>arch</literal> and <literal>zone</literal> variants are set by the
program that creates the image and installs its initial contents.</para>

action is installed.</para>
