MULTI-PLATFORM

The core pkg(5) technology is generic enough to be useful across multiple platforms
(e.g. Windows and Linux). The full range of supported platforms are listed here:
http://wikis.sun.com/display/IpsBestPractices/OS+Platform+Support

The following modules within the pkg(5) source base are multi-platform:
    - the CLIs (client.py, publish.py, depot.py, pull.py)
    - src/modules (the core of pkg(5))
    - src/tests (except the CLI tests do not run on Windows)
    - src/man
    - src/web
    - src/po (except for the GUI messages which are OpenSolaris-only)

The following modules are not multi-platform (only supported on OpenSolaris):
    - src/brand
    - src/gui, src/um and the start scripts (packagemanger.py, updatemanager.py,
        and updatemanagernotifier.py)
    - pkgdefs
    - SMF support: src/svc-pkg-depot, src/pkg-server.xml, src/pkg-update.xml
    - src/util

The following modules are only used for non-OpenSolaris support:
    - src/scripts

Multi-platform support is focused on providing support for user images as the 
operating system software is not delivered for other platforms using pkg(5).

Development best practices for writing multi-platform pkg(5) code are available
here: http://opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/devinfo/bestpractices/.

Build instructions for non-OpenSolaris platforms are here:
