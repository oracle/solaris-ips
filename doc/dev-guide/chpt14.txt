Republishing Packages
.....................

This chapter describes how administrators can modify existing packages for local
conditions.

Occasionally administrators need to override attributes or modify packages they
did not produce.  This might be to replace a portion of the package with an
internal implementation, or something as simple as removing binaries not
permitted on systems.

While other packaging systems provide various mechanisms to "force"
installation, IPS focuses instead on making it easy to republish an
existing package with the desired modifications. This makes upgrade
much easier since new versions can be re-published with the same
modifications.  It also enables the rest of the packaging system
to function normally since instead of forcing IPS to ignore changes,
packages reflect the correct, installed state of the system.

Of course, running a system with a republished package can cause
issues with the support organization if any connection is suspected
between observed problems and the modified package.

The basic steps are as follows:

 1. Use |pkgrecv| to download the package to be re-published in a *raw* format
    to a specified directory.  All of the files are named by their hash value,
    and the manifest is named ``manifest``.  Remember to set any required
    proxy configuration in the ``http_proxy`` environment variable.

 2. Use |pkgmogrify| to modify the manifest in the desired manner.  Any
    timestamp from the internal package FMRI should be removed to prevent
    confusion during publication as it is ignored.

    If changes are significant, running the resulting package through |pkglint|,
    as shown in *Chapter 4*, is a good idea.

 3. Republish the package with |pkgsend|.  Note that this republication
    will strip the package of any signatures that are present and will
    ignore any timestamp specified by ``pkg.fmri``.  To prevent a warning
    message you might want to remove signature actions in the |pkgmogrify| step.

    If the administrator doesn't have permission to publish to the
    original source of the package, they can create a repository with
    |pkgrepo|, then use ``pkg set-publisher --search-before=<original>``
    to have the client look for packages from the new repository before
    falling back to the original publisher.

 4. Optionally, sign the package using |pkgsign| so that internal processes can
    be followed. Packages should be signed before they are installed (even
    during testing) to prevent client caching issues.

Example 1: Change Package Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a simple example, where we change the ``pkg.summary`` field
to be ‘"IPS has lots of features"’ instead of whatever was there originally,
and republish to our new repository::

    $ mkdir republish; cd republish
    $ pkgrecv -d . --raw -s http://pkg.oracle.com/solaris/release package/pkg
    $ cd package*    # package name contains a '/', and is url-encoded.
    $ cd *           # we pulled down just the latest package by default
    $ cat > fix-pkg
    # change value of pkg.summary
    <transform set name=pkg.summary -> edit value '.*' "IPS has lots of features">
    # delete any signature actions
    <transform signature -> drop>
    # remove timestamp from fmri so we get our own
    <transform set name=pkg.fmri -> edit value ":20.+" "">
    ^D
    $ pkgmogrify manifest fix-pkg > new-manifest
    $ pkgrepo create ./mypkg
    $ pkgsend -s ./mypkg publish -d . new-manifest

Example 2: Change Package Publisher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another common use case is to republish packages under a new publisher
name.

This can be useful, for example, when consolidating the packages from several
different development teams' repositories into a single repository for
integration testing, a model that was used during development of Oracle Solaris.

Again, this can be achieved using the steps in *Example 1*, using
``pkgrecv --raw``, running a |pkgmogrify| transform on the resulting
manifest, then republishing the transformed manifest.

A sample transform to change the publisher to "mypublisher" is::

    <transform set name=pkg.fmri -> edit value pkg://[^/]+/ pkg://mypublisher/>

Iterating over all packages in the repository can be done with a simple shell
script, that uses the output from ``pkgrecv --newest`` to process only the
newest packages from the repository.

In the script below, we've saved the transform above in a file called
``change-pub.mog``, and want to in republish from ``development-repo``
to a new repository ``mypublisher``, changing the package publisher along the
way::

    #!/usr/bin/ksh93
    pkgrepo create mypublisher
    pkgrepo -s mypublisher set publisher/prefix=mypublisher
    mkdir incoming
    for package in $(pkgrecv -s ./development-repo --newest); do
        pkgrecv -s development-repo -d incoming --raw $package
    done

    for pdir in incoming/*/* ; do
        pkgmogrify $pdir/manifest change-pub.mog > $pdir/manifest.newpub
        pkgsend -s mypublisher publish -d $pdir $pdir/manifest.newpub
    done

If necessary, we could modify this script to select only certain packages,
make additional changes to the versioning scheme of the packages, and show
progress as it republishes each package, for example.
