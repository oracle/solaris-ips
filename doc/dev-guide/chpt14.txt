	Chapter 14, Package Republication, describes how administrators
	can modify existing packages if needed for local conditions.

Occasitionally administrators may wish or need to override attributes
or modify packages they did not produce.  This may be to replace a
portion of the package with an internal implementation, or something
as simple as removing binaries not permitted on systems.  While other
packaging systems provide various mechanisms to "force" installation,
the IPS team decided to make it easy to republish an existing package
with the desired modifications; this makes upgrade much easier since
new versions can be re-published with the same modifications.  It also
allows the rest of the packaging system to function normally since
instead of forcing IPS to ignore changes, we just change the
packages from the begining.

Of course, running a system with a republished package may cause
issues with the support organization if any connection is suspected
between observed problems and the modified package.

The basic steps are as follows:

 1) pkgrecv the package to be re-published in a raw format.  This
    pulls down the package under the specified directory in a special
    format:  all of the files are named by their hash value, and 
    the manifest is named "manifest".  Remember to set any needed
    proxy configuration in the http_proxy environment variable.

 2) Use pkgmogrify to modify the manifest in the desired manner.
    In order to prevent problems with machines caching package
    manifests, we always recommend deleting the timestamp from
    the internal package fmri.

    If changes are significant, running the resulting package 
    through pkglint as shown in chapter 4 is a good idea.

 3) Republish the package with pkgsend.  Note that this republication
    will strip the package of any signatures that are present; to
    prevent a (harmless) warning message you may wish to remove
    signature actions in the pkgmogrify step.

 4) Optionally, sign the package so that internal processes can be 
    followed.

Here's an simple manual example, where we change the pkg.summary field
to be "IPS has lots of features" instead of whatever was there originally:

  % mkdir republish; cd republish
  % pkgrecv -d . --raw -s http://pkg.oracle.com/solaris/release package/pkg
  % cd package*    # package name contains a '/', and is url-encoded.
  % cd *           # we pulled down just the latest package by default
  % cat > fix-pkg
  # change value of pkg.summary
  <transform set name=pkg.summary -> edit value '.*' "IPS has lots of features">
  # delete any signature actions
  <transform signature -> drop>
  # remove timestamp from fmri so we get our own
  <transform set name=pkg.fmri -> edit value ":20.+" "">
  ^D
  % pkgmogrify manifest fix-pkg > new-manifest
  % pkgrepo create ./mypkg
  % pkgrepo -s ./mypkg add-publisher solaris
  % pkgsend -s ./mypkg publish -d . new-manifest
