Appendix B

Converting SVR4 Packages to IPS
...............................

This appendix covers conversion of packages from SVR4 to IPS and highlights some
aspects of the conversion that should be given special attention.

*Chapter 4* goes into detail on how to package software in IPS.  Developers
with build environments that currently produce SVR4 packages should convert
their build processes following the example in that chapter, rather
than continuing to build SVR4 packages then converting those packages to IPS.

As with *Chapter 4*, the fundamental steps to packaging any software in IPS
are:

* Generate a package manifest.
* Add necessary metadata to the generated manifest.
* Evaluate dependencies.
* Add any facets or actuators that are needed.
* Check the package with |pkglint|.
* Publish the package.
* Test the package.

These steps remain essentially the same for SVR4 to IPS conversion and we will
not repeat their explanations.  There are a few steps that warrant more
detailed explanations, and which are covered in this appendix.

In this appendix, a sample SVR4 package which is similar to
the IPS package created in *Chapter 4* is used.

Generate a Package Manifest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pkgsend generate`` has support for scanning several different sources in
order to generate manifests.  In *Chapter 4*, we used a simple directory as the
source.  The |pkgsend| utility can also read SVR4 packages, consulting the
|pkgmap| file in that package, rather than the directory inside the package that
contains the files delivered.

While scanning the ``prototype`` file, |pkgsend| also looks for entries that could
cause problems when converting the package to IPS.  The |pkgsend| utility
reports those problems and prints the generated manifest.

In this example, a SVR4 package will be used that has a ``pkginfo`` file::

    VENDOR=My Software Inc.
    HOTLINE=Please contact your local service provider
    PKG=MSFTmypkg
    ARCH=i386
    DESC=A sample SVR4 package of My Sample Package
    CATEGORY=system
    NAME=My Sample Package
    BASEDIR=/
    VERSION=11.11,REV=2011.10.17.14.08
    CLASSES=none manpage
    PSTAMP=linn20111017132525
    MSFT_DATA=Some extra package metadata

.. raw:: pdf

    PageBreak

and a corresponding ``prototype`` file::

    i pkginfo
    i copyright
    i postinstall
    d none opt 0755 root bin
    d none opt/mysoftware 0755 root bin
    d none opt/mysoftware/lib 0755 root bin
    f none opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 0644 root bin
    d none opt/mysoftware/bin 0755 root bin
    f none opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd 0755 root bin
    d none opt/mysoftware/man 0755 root bin
    d none opt/mysoftware/man/man1 0755 root bin
    f none opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 0644 root bin

Running |pkgsend| on the SVR4 package built using these files, the following
IPS manifest is generated::

    $ pkgsend generate ./MSFTmypkg | pkgfmt
    pkgsend generate: ERROR: script present in MSFTmypkg: postinstall

    set name=pkg.summary value="My Sample Package"
    set name=pkg.description value="A sample SVR4 package of My Sample Package"
    set name=pkg.send.convert.msft-data value="Some extra package metadata"
    dir  path=opt owner=root group=bin mode=0755
    dir  path=opt/mysoftware owner=root group=bin mode=0755
    dir  path=opt/mysoftware/bin owner=root group=bin mode=0755
    file reloc/opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd path=opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd owner=root \
        group=bin mode=0755
    dir  path=opt/mysoftware/lib owner=root group=bin mode=0755
    file reloc/opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 path=opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 \
        owner=root group=bin mode=0644
    dir  path=opt/mysoftware/man owner=root group=bin mode=0755
    dir  path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1 owner=root group=bin mode=0755
    file reloc/opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 \
        path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 owner=root group=bin mode=0644
    legacy pkg=MSFTmypkg arch=i386 category=system \
        desc="A sample SVR4 package of My Sample Package" \
        hotline="Please contact your local service provider" \
        name="My Sample Package" vendor="My Software Inc." \
        version=11.11,REV=2011.10.17.14.08
    license install/copyright license=MSFTmypkg.copyright

There are several points to note in the output above:

    * The ``pkg.summary`` and ``pkg.description`` attributes were automatically
      created, using the data from the ``pkginfo`` file.

    * A ``set`` action was generated from the extra parameter in ``pkginfo``
      file.  These are set beneath the ``pkg.send.convert.*`` namespace, with
      the intention that developers will use |pkgmogrify| transforms to convert
      these to a more appropriate attribute name.

    * A ``legacy`` action was generated, using data from the SVR4 pkginfo file.

    * A ``license`` action was generated, pointing to the copyright file used
      in the SVR4 package.

    * An error message was emitted pointing to a scripting operation that can't
      be converted.

Checking again, we can see a non-zero return code from ``pkgsend generate``, and
the error message again::

    $ pkgsend generate  MSFTmypkg > /dev/null
    pkgsend generate: ERROR: script present in MSFTmypkg: postinstall
    $ echo $?
    1

In this case, the package is using a ``postinstall`` script that can't be
converted directly to an IPS equivalent. The script must be manually inspected.

This is the ``postinstall`` script in the package::

   #!/usr/bin/sh
   catman -M /opt/mysoftware/man

Its effects can easily be replaced by using a ``restart_fmri`` *actuator*
pointing to an existing SMF service, ``svc:/application/man-index:default`` as
described in *Chapter 4*.  Also, see *Chapter 9* for further discussion of
actuators.

``pkgsend generate`` will also check for the presence of class-action scripts
and will produce error messages indicating which scripts should be examined.

It is impossible to give examples for every package scripting scenario that a
developer can encounter when converting SVR4 packages to IPS packages.  In IPS,
the needed functionality probably can be implemented by using an existing action
type or SMF service.

See *Chapter 3* for details about the *action types* available, and *Chapter 9*
for a discussion on *actuators*.

Verify the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll assume that any additional package metadata needed has been added to the
manifest, and that dependency generation and resolution has been performed as per
*Chapter 4*.  Our next step is running |pkglint| on the package.

A common source of errors when converting old SVR4 packages is mismatched
attributes between directories delivered in the SVR4 package and those
delivered by other packages on the system.

In this case, the directory action for ``/opt`` in the sample manifest
has different attributes than those defined by the system packages.

Recall that in *Chapter 3*, we discussed the directory action, stating that
all reference-counted actions must have the same attributes.  When trying to
install the version of ``mypkg`` that has been generated so far, an error will
occur::

    # pkg install mypkg
    Creating Plan /
    pkg install: The requested change to the system attempts to install multiple actions
    for dir 'opt' with conflicting attributes:

        1 package delivers 'dir group=bin mode=0755 owner=root path=opt':
            pkg://mypublisher/mypkg@1.0,5.11-0:20111017T020042Z
        3 packages deliver 'dir group=sys mode=0755 owner=root path=opt':
            pkg://solaris/developer/build/onbld@0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.1.0:20111012T010101Z
            pkg://solaris/system/core-os@0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.1.0:20111012T023456Z

    These packages may not be installed together.  Any non-conflicting set may
    be, or the packages must be corrected before they can be installed.

To catch the error before publishing the package, rather than at install-time,
|pkglint| can be used with a reference repository::

    $ pkglint -c ./cache -r file:///scratch/solaris-repo ./mypkg.mf.res
    Lint engine setup...

    PHASE                                          ITEMS
    4                                          4292/4292
    Starting lint run...

    WARNING opensolaris.manifest001.1 Missing attribute 'org.opensolaris.consolidation' in pkg:/mypkg@1.0,5.11
    ERROR pkglint.dupaction007        path opt is reference-counted but has different attributes across 5
    duplicates: group: bin -> mypkg group: sys -> developer/build/onbld system/core-os system/ldoms/ldomsmanager

In particular, notice the error message it produces about /opt having incorrect
attributes.  The extra ``ldomsmanager`` package that |pkglint|
reports was in the reference package repository, but was not installed on the
test system, so it did not show up in the errors reported previously by
``pkg install``.

Other Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While it is possible to install SVR4 packages directly on a system running
IPS, we strongly recommend against this.

Apart from the ``legacy`` action, described in *Chapter 3*, there are no links
between the two packaging systems, and they do not reference package metadata
from each other.

IPS has commands such as ``pkg verify`` which can determine whether packaged
content has been installed correctly. However if another packaging system
legitimately installs packages, or runs install scripts that modify packaged
files from IPS, errors might result.

Commands such as ``pkg fix`` or ``pkg revert`` could overwrite files
that were delivered by a SVR4 package as well as an IPS package, potentially
causing the packaged applications to malfunction.

Similarly, commands such as ``pkg install``, which normally check for duplicate
actions and common attributes on reference-counted actions, could also fail to
detect potential errors when files from a different packaging system conflict.

With these pitfalls in mind, and given the comprehensive package development
tool chain in IPS, developing IPS packages instead of SVR4 packages is
recommended for Oracle Solaris 11.
