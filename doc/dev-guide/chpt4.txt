Packaging Software with IPS
...........................

This chapter describes how to package your software with IPS.  

Packaging software with IPS is usually straightforward due to
amount of automation that is provided.  Automation avoids
repetitive tedium since that seems to be the principle cause
of most packaging bugs.

Publication in IPS consists of the following steps:

1. Generate a package manifest.
2. Add necessary metadata to the generated manifest.
3. Evaluate dependencies.
4. Add any facets or actuators that are needed.
5. Verify the package.
6. Publish the package.
7. Test the package.

Each step is covered in the following sections.

Generate a Package Manifest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get started is to organize the component files into the same
directory structure that you want on the installed system.

This can be done with ``install`` target in Makefiles, or if the software
you want to package is already in a tarball, unpacking the tarball
into a subdirectory.  For many open source software packages that use
``autoconf(1)``, setting the DESTDIR environment variable to point to the
desired prototype area accomplishes this.

Suppose your software consists of a binary, a library and a man page,
and you want to install this software in a directory under ``/opt`` named
``mysoftware``.  You should create a directory (named ``proto`` in the
examples) in your build area under which your software appears; e.g::

   proto/opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 
   proto/opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd
   proto/opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1

Now, let's generate a manifest for this proto area.  We pipe it
through |pkgfmt| to format the manifest so that is more readable. Assuming
that the ``proto`` directory is in the current working directory::

  $ pkgsend generate proto | pkgfmt > mypkg.p5m.1

.. raw:: pdf

    PageBreak

Examining the file, you will see it contains the following lines::

  dir path=opt group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
  dir path=opt/mysoftware group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
  dir path=opt/mysoftware/bin group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
  dir path=opt/mysoftware/lib group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
  dir path=opt/mysoftware/man group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
  dir path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1 group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
  file opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd path=opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd group=bin \
      mode=0755 owner=root
  file opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 path=opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 \
      group=bin mode=0644 owner=root
  file opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 \
      group=bin mode=0644 owner=root

The path of the files to be packaged appears twice in the file action:

  * The first word after the word ‘``file``’ describes the location
    of the file in the proto area.

  * The path in the ‘``path=``’ attribute specifies the location
    where the file is to be installed.

This double entry enables you to modify the installation location without
modifying the ``proto`` area. This capability can save significant time, for example
if you repackage software that was designed for installation on a different
operating system.

Also, note that ``pkgsend generate`` has applied defaults for directory
owners and groups.  In the case of ``/opt``, the defaults are not correct;
we'll just delete that directory, since it's delivered by other packages
already on the system and |pkg| would not install the package if the
attributes of ``/opt`` conflicted with those already on the system.


Add Necessary Metadata to the Generated Manifest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A package should define the following metadata.
See also "Set Actions" in *Chapter 3*.

* ``pkg.fmri`` defines the name and version of the package as described in
  "Package" in *Chapter 3*. A description of Oracle Solaris versioning can
  be found in *Chapter 13*

* ``pkg.description`` is a description of the contents of the
  package.

* ``pkg.summary`` is a one-line synopsis of the description.

* ``variant.arch`` enumerates the architectures for which this package
  is suitable.  If the entire package can be installed on any 
  architecture, this can be omitted.  Producing packages that have
  different components for different architectures is discussed in
  *Chapter 7*.

* ``info.classification`` is a grouping scheme used by |packagemanager|,
  the IPS GUI.  The supported values are shown in *Appendix A*.
  In this case, we pick an arbitrary one for our sample package.

In addition, we will add a link action to ``/usr/share/man/index.d`` pointing to
our ``man`` directory, and discuss this link when covering *facets* and
*actuators* later in this chapter.

Rather than modifying the generated manifest directly, we'll use
|pkgmogrify| to edit the generated manifest.  A full description
of how |pkgmogrify| can be used to modify package manifests can be
found in *Chapter 8*.

In this example the macro capability is used to define the architecture,
as well as regular expression matching for the directory to elide
from the manifest.

Now we create a small file containing the information we want to
add to the manifest, as well as the transform needed to drop the ``opt``
directory from the manifest::

    set name=pkg.fmri value=mypkg@1.0,5.11-0
    set name=pkg.summary value="This is our example package"
    set name=pkg.description value="This is a full description of \
    all the interesting attributes of this example package." 
    set name=variant.arch value=$(ARCH)
    set name=info.classification \
        value=org.opensolaris.category.2008:Applications/Accessories
    link path=usr/share/man/index.d/mysoftware target=opt/mysoftware/man
    <transform dir path=opt$->drop>

Running |pkgmogrify| over ``mypkg.p5m.1`` with the above lines in
a file named mypkg.mog::

    $ pkgmogrify -DARCH=`uname -p` mypkg.p5m.1 mypkg.mog  | pkgfmt > mypkg.p5m.2

Examining the file we see::

    set name=pkg.fmri value=mypkg@1.0,5.11-0
    set name=pkg.description \
        value="This is a full description of all the interesting attributes of this example package. "
    set name=pkg.summary value="This is our example package"
    set name=info.classification \
        value=org.opensolaris.category.2008:Applications/Accessories
    set name=variant.arch value=i386
    link path=usr/share/man/index.d/mysoftware target=opt/mysoftware/man
    dir path=opt/mysoftware group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/bin group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/lib group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1 group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    file opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd path=opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd group=bin \
        mode=0755 owner=root
    file opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 path=opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 \
        group=bin mode=0644 owner=root
    file opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 \
        group=bin mode=0644 owner=root
    link path=usr/share/man/index.d/mysoftware target=../../../../opt/mysoftware/man

Note that the directory action defining ``opt`` has been removed, and the
manifest contents from ``mypkg.mog`` have been added to our package.


Evaluate Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the |pkgdepend| command to automatically generate dependencies for the
package. The generated depend actions are defined in *Chapter 3* and discussed
further in *Chapter 6*.

Dependency generation is composed of two separate steps:

  1. Determine the files on which our software depends.
  2. Determine the packages that contain those files.

These steps are referred to as *dependency generation* and
*dependency resolution* and are performed using the ``generate`` and ``resolve``
subcommands of |pkgdepend|, respectively.

.. raw:: pdf

    PageBreak

First, we'll generate our dependencies::

    $ pkgdepend generate -md proto mypkg.p5m.2 | pkgfmt > mypkg.p5m.3

The ``-m`` option causes |pkgdepend| to include the entire manifest in
its output, and the ``-d`` option passes the ``proto`` directory to the command.

In this new file, we see::

	    set name=pkg.fmri value=mypkg@1.0,5.11-0
	    set name=pkg.description \
		value="This is a full description of all the interesting attributes of this example package."
	    set name=pkg.summary value="This is our example package"
	    set name=info.classification \
		value=org.opensolaris.category.2008:Applications/Accessories
	    set name=variant.arch value=i386
	    dir path=opt/mysoftware group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
	    dir path=opt/mysoftware/bin group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
	    dir path=opt/mysoftware/lib group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
	    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
	    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1 group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
	    file opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd path=opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd group=bin \
		mode=0755 owner=root
	    file opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 path=opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 \
		group=bin mode=0644 owner=root
	    file opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 \
		group=bin mode=0644 owner=root
	    link path=usr/share/man/index.d/mysoftware target=../../../../opt/mysoftware/man
	    depend fmri=__TBD pkg.debug.depend.file=libc.so.1 \
		pkg.debug.depend.reason=opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd \
		pkg.debug.depend.type=elf type=require pkg.debug.depend.path=lib \
		pkg.debug.depend.path=opt/mysoftware/lib pkg.debug.depend.path=usr/lib
	    depend fmri=__TBD pkg.debug.depend.file=libc.so.1 \
		pkg.debug.depend.reason=opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 \
		pkg.debug.depend.type=elf type=require pkg.debug.depend.path=lib \
		pkg.debug.depend.path=usr/lib

|pkgdepend| has added notations about a dependency on ``libc.so.1`` by both
``mylib.so.1`` and ``mycmd``.  Note that the internal dependency between
``mycmd`` and ``mylib.so.1`` is currently silently elided by |pkgdepend|.

Now we need to resolve these dependencies.  To resolve dependencies,
|pkgdepend| examines the packages currently installed on the machine used
for building the software.  By default, |pkgdepend| puts its output in
``mypkg.p5m.3.res``.  Note that this takes a while to run as it loads lots of
information about the system on which it is running.  |pkgdepend| will resolve
many packages at once if you want to amortize this time over all packages;
running it on one package at a time is not time efficient.

::

    $ pkgdepend resolve -m mypkg.p5m.3

.. raw:: pdf

    PageBreak

When this completes, ``mypkg.p5m.3.res`` contains::

    set name=pkg.fmri value=mypkg@1.0,5.11-0
    set name=pkg.description \
        value="This is a full description of all the interesting attributes of this example package."
    set name=pkg.summary value="This is our example package"
    set name=info.classification \
        value=org.opensolaris.category.2008:Applications/Accessories
    set name=variant.arch value=i386
    dir path=opt/mysoftware group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/bin group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/lib group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1 group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    file opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd path=opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd group=bin \
        mode=0755 owner=root
    file opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 path=opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1 \
        group=bin mode=0644 owner=root
    file opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 \
        group=bin mode=0644 owner=root
    link path=usr/share/man/index.d/mysoftware target=opt/mysoftware/man
    depend fmri=pkg:/system/library@0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1 type=require

|pkgdepend| has converted the notation about the file dependency on
``libc.so.1`` to a package dependency on ``pkg:/system/library`` which delivers
that file.

We recommended that developers use |pkgdepend| to generate dependencies,
rather than declaring ``depend`` actions manually.  Manual dependencies can
become incorrect or unnecessary as the package contents might change over time.
This could happen, for example, when a file that an application depends on gets
moved to a different package. Any manually declared dependencies on that package
would then be out of date.

Some manually declared dependencies might be necessary if |pkgdepend| is unable
to determine dependencies completely, in which case we recommend that comments
are added to the manifest to explain the nature of each dependency.


Add Any Facets or Actuators That Are Needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Facets and actuators are discussed in more detail in *Chapter 7* and
*Chapter 9*. Facets allow us to denote actions that are not required but can
be optionally installed.  Actuators specify system changes that must occur
when an action in our package is installed, updated, or removed.

Since we are delivering a man page in ``opt/mysoftware/man/man1`` we would
like to add a facet to indicate that documentation is optional.

We would also like an SMF service, ``svc:/application/man-index:default``, to be
restarted when our package is installed, so that our man page is included in the
index.  The 'restart_fmri' actuator can perform that task.

The ``man-index`` service looks in ``/usr/share/man/index.d`` for symbolic
links to directories containing man pages, adding the target of each link to
the list of directories it scans, hence our earlier addition of that link to
our man pages.  This is a good example of the *self-assembly* idiom that was
discussed in *Chapter 1*, and is used throughout the packaging of the OS
itself.

Oracle Solaris ships with a set of |pkgmogrify| transforms that were used to
package the the operating system, in ``/usr/share/pkg/transforms``.  These
transforms are discussed in more detail in *Chapter 8*.

The file called ``documentation`` contains the transforms that are closest to
what we need here, though since we're delivering our man page to ``/opt``,
we'll use the ``documentation`` transforms file as a guide, and use the
following transforms instead.  These transforms include a regular expression
``opt/.+/man(/.+)?`` which match all paths beneath ``opt`` that contain a
``man`` subdirectory::

    <transform dir file link hardlink path=opt/.+/man(/.+)? -> \
        default facet.doc.man true>

    <transform file path=opt/.+/man(/.+)? -> \
        add restart_fmri svc:/application/man-index:default>

We can run our manifest through this transform using::

    $ pkgmogrify mypkg.p5m.3.res /tmp/doc-transform | pkgfmt > mypkg.p5m.4.res

which changes the three man-page-related actions in our manifest, from::

    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    dir path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1 group=bin mode=0755 owner=root
    file opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 \
        group=bin mode=0644 owner=root

to::

    dir  path=opt/mysoftware/man owner=root group=bin mode=0755 facet.doc.man=true
    dir  path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1 owner=root group=bin mode=0755 \
        facet.doc.man=true
    file opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 path=opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1 \
        owner=root group=bin mode=0644 \
        restart_fmri=svc:/application/man-index:default facet.doc.man=true

For efficiency, we could have included this transform when originally adding
metadata to our package, before running |pkgdepend|.


Verify the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last thing we need to do before publication is run |pkglint| on our
manifest.  This helps us determine whether we've made any errors while writing
the manifest that we'd like to catch before publication.  Some of the errors
that |pkglint| can catch are ones also caught either at publication time, or
when a user tries to install a package, but obviously, we'd like to catch
errors as early as possible in the package authoring process.

For example, |pkglint| checks that the package doesn't
deliver files already owned by another package, and that all metadata for
shared, reference-counted actions (such as directories) is consistent across
packages.

There are two modes in which to run |pkglint|:

  * Directly on the manifest itself
  * On the manifest, also referencing a repository

For developers who want to quickly check the validity of their manifests, using
the first form is usually sufficient.  The second form is recommended to be run
*at least once* before publication to a repository.

By referencing a repository, |pkglint| can perform additional checks to ensure
that the package interacts well with other packages in that repository.

The full list of checks that |pkglint| performs can be shown with ``pkglint -L``.
Detailed information on how to enable, disable and bypass particular checks
is given in the |pkglint| man page.  It also details how to extend |pkglint| to
run additional checks.

In the case of our test package, we see::

    $ pkglint mypkg.p5m.4.res
    Lint engine setup...
    Starting lint run...
    WARNING opensolaris.manifest001.1 Missing attribute
        'org.opensolaris.consolidation' in pkg:/mypkg@1.0,5.11-0
    WARNING pkglint.action005.1       obsolete dependency check skipped: unable
        to find dependency pkg:/system/library@0.5.11-0.168 for
        pkg:/mypkg@1.0,5.11-0

These warnings are acceptable for our purposes:

  * ``opensolaris.manifest001.1`` is warning us that we haven't declared a tag
    that is generally only required for bundled Oracle Solaris software, so we
    can ignore this warning.

  * ``pkglint.action005.1`` is warning us that |pkglint| wasn't able to find a
    package called ``pkg:/system/library@0.5.11-0.168`` which we have generated
    a dependency on.  Since |pkglint| was called with just the manifest file as
    an argument, it does not know which repository that package is present in,
    hence the warning.

When |pkglint| is run with a ``-r`` flag referencing a repository containing
the package that our test package has a dependency on, we see::

    $ pkglint -c ./solaris-reference -r http://pkg.oracle.com/solaris11/release mypkg.p5m.4.res
    Lint engine setup...

    PHASE                                          ITEMS
    4                                          4292/4292
    Starting lint run...

    WARNING opensolaris.manifest001.1 Missing attribute 'org.opensolaris.consolidation' in pkg:/mypkg@1.0,5.11-0
    $



Publish the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that our package is created, dependencies are added, and it has been
checked for correctness, we can publish the package.

IPS provides three different ways to deliver a package:

  * Publish to a local file-based repository
  * Publish to a remote HTTP-based repository
  * Convert to a ``.p5p`` package archive

Generally, publishing to a file-based repository is sufficient while testing
a package.

If the package needs to be transferred to other machines which cannot access
the package repositories, converting one or more packages to a package archive
can be convenient.

The package can also be published directly to an HTTP repository, hosted
on a machine with a read/write instance of ``svc:/application/pkg/server``
(which in turn runs |pkg.depotd|).

We do not generally recommend this method of publication since there are no
authorization/authentication checks on the incoming package when publishing over
HTTP. Publishing to HTTP repositories can be convenient on secure networks or
when testing the same package across several machines if NFS or SMB access to
the file repository is not possible.

Installing packages over HTTP (or preferably HTTPS) is fine, however.

Local File Repositories
```````````````````````

|pkgrepo| can be used to create and manage repositories.  We choose a
location on our system, create a repository, then set the default publisher
for that repository::

    $ pkgrepo create /scratch/my-repository
    $ pkgrepo -s /scratch/my-repository set publisher/prefix=mypublisher
    $ find /scratch/my-repository/
    /scratch/my-repository/
    /scratch/my-repository/pkg5.repository

We can now use ``pkgsend`` to publish our package, and ``pkgrepo`` to examine
the repository afterwards::

    $ pkgsend -s /scratch/my-repository/ publish -d proto mypkg.p5m.4.res
    pkg://mypublisher/mypkg@1.0,5.11-0:20111012T034303Z
    PUBLISHED
    $ pkgrepo -s /scratch/my-repository info
    PUBLISHER   PACKAGES STATUS           UPDATED
    mypublisher 1        online           2011-10-12T03:43:04.117536Z

The file repository can then be served over HTTP or HTTPS using |pkg.depotd|
if required.

Package Archives
````````````````

Package archives enable you to distribute groups of packages in a single file.
We can use |pkgrecv| to create package archives from package repositories,
and vice versa.

Package archives can be easily downloaded from an existing website, copied to
a USB key or burned to a DVD for installation in cases where a package
repository is not available.

In the case of our simple file repository above, we can create an archive
from this repository with the following command::

    $ pkgrecv -s /scratch/my-repository -a -d myarchive.p5p mypkg
    Retrieving packages for publisher mypublisher ...
    Retrieving and evaluating 1 package(s)...
    DOWNLOAD                                  PKGS       FILES    XFER (MB)
    Completed                                  1/1         3/3      0.7/0.7
    
    
    ARCHIVE                                             FILES   STORE (MB)
    myarchive.p5p                                       14/14      0.7/0.7

We can list the newest available packages from a repository using pkgrepo::

   $ pkgrepo -s /scratch/my-repository list '*@latest'
   PUBLISHER    NAME                          O VERSION
   mypublisher  mypkg                           1.0,5.11-0:20111012T033207Z

This output can be useful when constructing scripts to create archives with
the latest versions of all packages from a given repository.

Temporary repositories or package archives provided with the ``-g`` flag for
``pkg install`` and other package operations cannot be used on systems with
child or parent images (non-global zones have a child/parent relationship with
the global zone) since the system repository does not get temporarily configured
with that publisher information.

Package archives can be set as sources of local publishers in non-global zones,
however.

Test the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having published our package, we are interested in seeing whether it has been
packaged properly.

In this example, we ensure that our user has the *Software Installation*
Profile, in order to be able to install packages without root privileges,
then we add the publisher in our repository to the system::

    $ sudo su
    Password:
    # usermod -P 'Software Installation' myuser
    Found user in files repository.
    UX: usermod: myuser is currently logged in, some changes may not take effect
    until next login.
    ^D
    $ pfexec pkg set-publisher -p /scratch/my-repository
    pkg set-publisher:
      Added publisher(s): mypublisher

You can use ``pkg install`` -nv to see what the install command will do without
making any changes. The following example actually installs the package::

    $ pfexec pkg install mypkg
               Packages to install:  1
           Create boot environment: No
    Create backup boot environment: No

    DOWNLOAD                                  PKGS       FILES    XFER (MB)
    Completed                                  1/1         3/3      0.7/0.7

We can then examine the software as it was delivered on the system::

    $ find /opt/mysoftware/
    /opt/mysoftware/
    /opt/mysoftware/bin
    /opt/mysoftware/bin/mycmd
    /opt/mysoftware/lib
    /opt/mysoftware/lib/mylib.so.1
    /opt/mysoftware/man
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man-index
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man-index/term.doc
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man-index/.index-cache
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man-index/term.dic
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man-index/term.req
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man-index/term.pos
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man1
    /opt/mysoftware/man/man1/mycmd.1

In addition to the binaries and man page showing up, we can see that the system
has also generated the man page indexes as a result of our actuator restarting
the ``man-index`` service.

We can see that ``pkg info`` shows the metadata that we added to our package::

    $ pkg info mypkg
              Name: mypkg

our package::

    $ pkg search -l mycmd.1
    INDEX      ACTION VALUE                           PACKAGE
