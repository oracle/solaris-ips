Basic Terminology
.................

This chapter defines IPS terms and describes the IPS components.

Image
~~~~~

IPS is designed to install packages in an image.  An image is a directory
tree, and can be mounted in a variety of locations as needed.  Images
are of three types:

  Full 
         in a full image,  all dependencies are resolved within the 
         image itself and IPS maintains the dependencies in a consistent
         manner;

  Zone 
         in a zone image, IPS maintains the zone consistent with its
         global zone as defined by dependencies in the packages;

  User
         not yet fully functional for Oracle Solaris.

In general, images are created or cloned by other software (installers,
|beadm|, |zonecfg|, etc) rather than directly by the user.  

Package
~~~~~~~

IPS deals with all software installed on a system in the granularity of
packages.  Every package is represented by a *fault management resource
identifier* (FMRI), consisting of a publisher, a name, and a version, with
the scheme ‘``pkg``’.  For example::

    pkg://solaris/system/library@0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1:20111019T082311Z

Here, ‘``solaris``’ is the publisher, ‘``system/library``’ is the package
name, and ‘``0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1:20111019T082311Z``’ is the version.

Package names are hierarchical with an arbitrary number of components
separated by forward slash (‘``/``’) characters.  Package names form a
single namespace across publishers; packages with the same name and
version but different publishers are assumed to be interchangeable in terms
of external dependencies and interfaces.  Package name components are case
sensitive and  must start with a letter or number, but can include
underscores (‘``_``’), dashes (‘``-``’), periods (‘``.``’), and plus signs
(‘``+``’) in later positions.

FMRIs can appear and can be referred to in abbreviated form.  The scheme
is typically unnecessary, leaving the FMRI to start with either a double
slash (‘``//``’) or a single slash (‘``/``’).  When the first slash is
doubled, the first word following the slash is the publisher name.  When
there is only a single leading slash, no publisher name is present, and the
package name is considered complete, or ‘rooted’.

Further abbreviation is possible by eliding leading components of package
names.  For instance, ``/driver/network/ethernet/e1000g`` can be reduced to
``network/ethernet/e1000g``, ``ethernet/e1000g``, or even simply
``e1000g``.  Note that such abbreviation mighy cause the packaging client to
complain about ambiguous package names, in which case disambiguation can
always be achieved by specifying the full, rooted name.  Typically package
names are chosen to reduce possible ambiguities, even when referred to
solely by their last component.  Some trailing components are common,
however; in such cases, the last two components should be unambiguous.
Scripts should generally refer to packages by their full, rooted names.

It is not possible to construct an abbreviated FMRI that contains a
publisher name and only trailing package name components.

The version is also often unnecessary; packages referred to without version
will generally resolve to the latest version of the package that can be
installed.  As explained below, versions themselves need not be complete.

FMRIs can also be referred to with patterns, where an asterisk (‘``*``’)
can match any portion of a package name.  Thus ``/driver/*/e1000g`` will
expand to ``/driver/network/ethernet/e1000g``, as will ``/dri*00g``.


Version
```````

A package version consists of four sequences of integer numbers,
separated by punctuation.  The elements in the first three sequences
are separated by dots, and the sequences are arbitrarily long.
Leading zeros in version components (e.g. ‘``01.1``’ or ‘``1.01``’) are
forbidden, to allow for unambiguous sorting by package version.

An example version is::

    0.5.11,5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1:20111019T082311Z

The first part is the component version.  For components that are
are developed as part of Oracle Solaris, this will represent the point
in the release when this package last changed.  For a component with its
own development life cycle, this sequence is the dotted release
number, such as ‘``2.4.10``’.

The second part, which if present must follow a comma, is the build
version.  Oracle Solaris uses this to denote the release of the OS for
which the package was compiled.

The third part, which if present must follow a dash, is the branch version,
providing vendor-specific information.  This can be incremented when the
packaging metadata is changed, independently of the component; can contain
a build number; or provide some other information.

The fourth part, which if present must follow a colon, is a timestamp.
It represents when the package was published in the GMT timezone, and is
automatically updated when the package is published.

The package versions are ordered using left-to-right precedence; thus
the timestamp is the least significant part of the version space; the
number immediately after the ‘``@``’ is the most significant.

If required, ``pkg.human-version`` can be used to hold a human-readable
version string, however the versioning scheme described above must
also be present.   The human-readable version string is only used for
display purposes, and is documented later in this chapter.

By allowing arbitrary version lengths, IPS can accommodate a variety
of different models for supporting software. Within the confines
of a given component version, a package author can use the build or branch
versions and assign one portion of the versioning scheme to security
updates, another for paid vs. unpaid support updates, another for minor bug
fixes, etc.

A version can also be the token ‘``latest``’, which is substituted for the
latest version known.

We discuss how Oracle Solaris implements versioning in *Chapter 13*.

Publisher
~~~~~~~~~

A publisher is an entity that develops and constructs packages.  A
publisher name, or prefix, is used to identify this source in a unique
manner.  The use of Internet domains or registered trademarks is
encouraged, since it provides a natural namespace partitioning.

Package clients combine all specified sources of packages for a given
publisher when computing packaging solutions.  Publisher names can
include upper and lower case letters, numbers, dashes and periods; the same
characters as a valid hostname.

Action
~~~~~~

Actions are used to define the software that comprises a package; they
define the data needed to create this software component.  When creating
packages, the developer expresses the package contents as a set of actions
then saves those to a *package manifest* file.

Actions look like this:

.. parsed-literal::

    *action_name* *attribute1*\=\ *value1* *attribute2*\=\ *value2* ...

As a concrete example::

    dir path=a/b/c group=sys mode=0755 owner=root

The first field identifies this as a ``dir`` (or directory) action; the
``name=value`` attributes describe the familiar properties of that
directory.  In the cases where the action has data associated with it,
such as a file, the action looks like this::

    file 11dfc625cf4b266aaa9a77a73c23f5525220a0ef path=etc/release owner=root \
        group=sys mode=0444 chash=099953b6a315dc44f33bca742619c636cdac3ed6 \
        pkg.csize=139 pkg.size=189 variant.arch=i386

Here the second attribute (without a ``name=`` prefix), called the
payload, is the SHA-1 hash of the file.  This attribute can alternatively
appear as a regular attribute with the name ``hash``; if both forms are
present they must have the same value.

Action metadata is freely extensible; additional attributes can be
added to actions as desired.  Attribute names cannot include spaces,
quotes, or equals signs (‘``=``’).  Attribute values can have all of those,
although values with spaces must be enclosed in single or double quotes.  Single
quotes need not be escaped inside of a double-quoted string, and vice
versa, though a quote can be prefixed with a backslash (‘``\``’) so as not
to terminate the quoted string.  Backslashes can be escaped with
backslashes.  It is recommended that custom attributes use a reverse
domain name or similar unique prefix to prevent accidental namespace
overlap.

Multiple attributes with the same name can be present and are
treated as unordered lists.

Note that manifests are largely created using programs; it is not
expected that that developers produce complete manifests by hand, but
rather create skeletons with the minimal non-redundant information, and
have the rest filled in with tools such as |pkgmogrify| and |pkgdepend|.

Most actions have key attributes; this attribute is what makes this
action unique from all others in the image.  For file system
objects, this is the path for that object.


Types of Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are currently twelve action types in IPS.  The following
sections describe each action type, and the attributes that
define these actions.  The action types are detailed in the |pkg5| man
page, and are repeated here for reference.

Each section contains an example action, as it would appear in a manifest
during package creation.  Other attributes might be automatically added
to the action during publication.

File Actions
````````````
     The ``file`` action is by far the most common action, and represents an
     ‘ordinary file’. The file action references a payload, and has four
     standard attributes:

     path
              The file system path where the file  is  installed.
              This is a file action's key attribute.  These are relative
              to the root of the image.

     mode
              The access permissions (in  numeric  form)  of  the
              file. These are simple permissions only, not ACLs.

     owner
              The name of the user that owns the file.

     group
              The name of the group that owns the file.

     The payload is a positional attribute  in  that  it  is  not
     named. It is the first word after the action name. In a published
     manifest, it is the SHA-1 hash of the file  contents.
     If  present  in  a manifest that has yet to be published, it
     represents the path where the  payload  can  be  found.  See
     |pkgsend|.  The  ``hash``  attribute can be used instead of the
     positional attribute, should the  value  include  an  equals
     sign.  Both  can  be  used  in the same action. However, the
     hashes must be identical.


     Other attributes include:

     preserve
                 This specifies that the file's  contents  should
                 not  be  overwritten  on upgrade if the contents
                 are determined to have changed  since  the  file
                 was  installed  or  last  upgraded.  On  initial
                 installs, if an existing file is found, the file
                 is salvaged (stored in ``/var/pkg/lost+found``).

                 * If the value of ``preserve`` is ``renameold``, then  the
                   existing  file  is  renamed  with  the extension
                   ``.old``, and the new file is put in its place.

                 * If the value of ``preserve`` is ``renamenew``, then  the
                   existing file is left alone, and the new file is
                   installed with the extension ``.new``.

                 * If the value of ``preserve`` is ``legacy``,  then  this
                   file   is  not  installed  for  initial  package
                   installs. On  upgrades,  any  existing  file  is
                   renamed with the extension ``.legacy``, and then the
                   new file is put in its place.

                 * If the value of ``preserve`` is ``true`` (or a value not
                   listed  above,  such  as  ``strawberry``),  then the
                   existing file is left alone, and the new file is
                   not installed.  Other values with specific meanings might
                   be added in future, so using ``true`` should be used if
                   this functionality is required.

     overlay
                 This specifies whether the action  allows  other
                 packages  to deliver a file at the same location
                 or whether it delivers a file intended to  overlay
                 another. This functionality is intended for
                 use with configuration files that do not  participate
                 in   any  self-assembly  (for  example,
                 ``/etc/motd``) and that can be safely overwritten.

                 * If ``overlay`` is not specified,  multiple  packages
                   cannot deliver files to the same location.

                 * If the value of ``overlay`` is  ``allow``,  one  other
                   package is allowed to deliver a file to the same
                   location. This value has no  effect  unless  the
                   ``preserve`` attribute is also set.

                 * If the  value  of  ``overlay``  is  ``true``,  the  file
                   delivered  by  the  action  overwrites any other
                   action that has specified ``allow``.

                   Changes to  the installed  file are preserved based on the
                   value of the  ``preserve``  attribute  of  the  overlaying
                   file.  On  removal, the contents of the file are
                   preserved if the action being overlaid is  still
                   installed,  regardless  of  whether the ``preserve``
                   attribute was specified.  Only  one  action  can
                   overlay  another, and the ``mode``, ``owner``, and ``group``
                   attributes must match.

     original_name
              This attribute is used to  handle  editable
              files  moving  from  package  to package or
              from place to place, or both. The form this
              takes  is the name of the originating package,
              followed by a colon and  the  original
              path to the file. Any file being deleted is
              recorded either with its package and  path,
              or  with  the  value  of  the ``original_name``
              attribute if specified. Any  editable file
              being  installed that has the ``original_name``
              attribute set uses the file of that name if
              it is deleted as part of the same packaging
              operation.

              Note that once set, this attribute should never
              change even if the package or file are repeatedly renamed;
              this will permit upgrade to occur from all previous versions.

     revert-tag
              This attribute  is  used  to  tag  editable
              files  that  should  be  reverted as a set.
              Multiple ``revert-tag`` values  can  be  specified
              The  file  reverts  to its manifest-defined
              state when ``pkg revert``  is  invoked
              with  any  of  those  tags  specified.  See
              |pkg|.

     Specific types of file can have additional attributes.  For ELF files,
     the following attributes are recognized:

     elfarch
              The architecture of the ELF file.  This will is the output of
              ``uname -p`` on the architecture for which the file is built.

     elfbits
              This is ``32`` or ``64``.

     elfhash
              This is the hash of the  ‘interesting’  ELF
              sections  in  the  file. These are the sections
              that are mapped into memory when the binary is loaded.

              These are the only sections necessary to consider when
              determining whether the executable behavior of two binaries
              will differ.

     An example ``file`` action is::

         file path=usr/bin/pkg owner=root group=bin mode=0755


Directory Actions
`````````````````

     The ``dir`` action is like the ``file`` action in that it represents
     a  file system object, except that it represents a directory
     instead of an ordinary file. The ``dir``  action  has  the  same
     four standard attributes as the ``file`` action (``path``, ``owner``,
     ``group`` and ``mode``), and ``path`` is the key attribute.

     Directories are reference counted  in  IPS.  When  the  last
     package  that  either  explicitly or implicitly references a
     directory no longer does so, that directory is  removed.  If
     that  directory  contains  unpackaged  file  system objects,
     those items are moved into ``/var/pkg/lost+found``.

     To move unpackaged contents into a new directory,  the  following
     attribute might be useful:

     salvage-from
                     This names a directory of salvaged items.  A
                     directory with such an attribute inherits on
                     creation the salvaged directory contents  if
                     they exist.

     During installation, |pkg| will check that all instances of a given
     directory action on the system have the same owner, group and mode
     attributes, and will not install the action if conflicting actions
     will exist on the system as a result of the operation.

     An example of a ``dir`` action is::

         dir  path=usr/share/lib owner=root group=sys mode=0755

Link Actions
````````````

     The ``link`` action represents a symbolic link. The ``link`` action
     has the following standard attributes:

     path
         The file system path where the symbolic link is
         installed. This is a ``link`` action's key attribute.

     target
         The target of the symbolic link. The file system object
         to which the link resolves.

     The ``link`` action also takes attributes that allow for multiple
     versions or implementations of a given piece of software to be
     installed on the system at the same time.  Such links are *mediated*,
     and allow administrators to easily toggle which links point to which
     version or implementation as desired.  These *mediated links* are
     discussed in *Chapter 10*.

     An example of a ``link`` action is::

         link path=usr/lib/libpython2.6.so target=libpython2.6.so.1.0

Hardlink Actions
````````````````

     The ``hardlink`` action represents a hard link.  It has the same
     attributes as the link action, and ``path`` is also its key attribute.

     An example of a ``hardlink`` action is::

         hardlink path=opt/myapplication/hardlink target=foo

Set Actions
```````````

     The ``set`` action represents a package-level attribute, or metadata,
     such as the package description.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     name
              The name of the attribute.

     value
              The value given to the attribute.

     The ``set`` action can deliver any metadata the package author chooses.
     However, there are a number of well-defined attribute names that have
     specific meaning to the packaging system.


     pkg.fmri
                           The name and version of the containing package.

     info.classification
                           One or more tokens that a |pkg5| client can use
                           to classify the package.  The value should have
                           a scheme (such as ``org.opensolaris.category.2008``
                           or ``org.acm.class.1998``) and the actual
                           classification, such as ``Applications/Games``,
                           separated by a colon (‘``:``’).  The scheme is
                           used by the |packagemanager| GUI.  A set of
                           ``info.classification`` values is included in
                           *Appendix A*.

     pkg.summary
                           A brief synopsis of the description.  This is
                           output with ``pkg list -s`` at the end of each
                           line, as well as in one line of the output of
                           ``pkg info``, so it should be no longer than
                           sixty characters.  It should describe *what* a
                           package is, and should refrain from repeating
                           the name or version of the package.

     pkg.description
                           A detailed description of the contents and
                           functionality of the package, typically a
                           paragraph or so in length.  It should describe
                           *why* someone might want to install the package.

     pkg.obsolete
                           When ``true``, the package is marked obsolete.  An
                           obsolete package can have no actions other than
                           more ``set`` actions, and must not be marked renamed.
                           Package obsoletion is covered in *Chapter 10*

     pkg.renamed
                           When ``true``, the package has been renamed.
                           There must be one or more ``depend`` actions in
                           the package as well which point to the package
                           versions to which this package has been renamed.
                           A package cannot be marked both renamed and
                           obsolete, but otherwise can have any number of
                           ``set`` actions.  Package renaming is covered in
                           *Chapter 10*.

     pkg.human-version
                           The version scheme used by IPS is strict, and
                           does not allow for letters or words in the
                           ``pkg.fmri`` version field.  If there is a commonly
                           used human-readable version available for a given
                           package, that can be set here, and is displayed
                           by IPS tools.  It does not get used as a basis for
                           version comparison and cannot be used in place of
                           the ``pkg.fmri`` version.

     Some additional informational attributes, as well as some used by
     Oracle Solaris are described in *Chapter 13*.

     An example of a ``set`` action is::

         set name=pkg.summary value="Image Packaging System"

Driver Actions
``````````````

     The driver action represents a  device  driver.  The  driver
     action  does not reference a payload. The driver files themselves
     must be installed as ``file`` actions.  The  following
     attributes are recognized (see ``add_drv(1M)`` for more information):

     name
                    The name of the driver. This is usually,  but
                    not  always, the file name of the driver
                    binary.  This is the ``driver`` action's  key
                    attribute.

     alias
                    This represents an alias for  the  driver.  A
                    given  driver  can  have  more than one ``alias``
                    attribute.  No special quoting rules are
                    necessary.

     class
                    This represents a driver class.  A given
                    driver can have more than one ``class`` attribute.

     perms
                    This represents the file system permissions
                    for the driver's device nodes.

     clone_perms
                    This represents the file system permissions
                    for the clone driver's minor nodes for this
                    driver.

     policy
                    This specifies additional security policy for
                    the device. A given driver can have more than
                    one ``policy`` attribute, but no minor device
                    specification can be present in more than one
                    attribute.

     privs
                    This specifies privileges used by the driver.
                    A given driver can have more than one ``privs``
                    attribute.

     devlink
                    This specifies an entry in ``/etc/devlink.tab``.
                    The value is the exact line to go into the
                    file, with tabs denoted by ‘``\t``’. See
                    ``devlinks(1M)`` for more information. A given
                    driver can have more than one ``devlink``
                    attribute.

     An example of a driver action is::

         driver name=vgatext \
             alias=pciclass,000100 \
             alias=pciclass,030000 \
             alias=pciclass,030001 \
             alias=pnpPNP,900 variant.arch=i386 variant.opensolaris.zone=global

Depend Actions
``````````````

     The ``depend`` action represents an inter-package dependency.  A package
     can depend on another package because the first requires functionality
     in the second for the functionality in the first to work, or even to
     install.  Dependencies are covered in more detail in *Chapter 6*.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     fmri
           The FMRI representing the target of the dependency.  This is the
           dependency action’s key attribute.  The FMRI value must not
           include the publisher.  The  package  name  is assumed to be
           complete (that is, rooted), even if it does not begin with a forward
           slash (‘``/``’).
           Dependencies of type ``require-any`` can have multiple ``fmri``
           attributes.  A version is optional on the ``fmri`` value, though
           for some types of dependencies, an FMRI with no version has no
           meaning.

           The FMRI value cannot use asterisks, and cannot use the
           ``latest`` token for a version.

     type
           The type of the dependency.

           * If the value is ``require``, then the target package
             is required  and must have a version equal to
             or greater than the version specified in the
             ``fmri`` attribute.  If the version is not specified,
             any version satisfies the dependency.  A
             package cannot be installed if any of its
             required dependencies cannot be satisfied.

           * If the value is ``optional``, then the target, if present, must
             be at the specified version level or greater.

           * If the value is ``exclude``, then the containing package cannot
             be installed if the target is present at the specified
             version level or greater.  If no version is specified, the
             target package cannot be installed concurrently with the
             package specifying the dependency.

           * If the value is ``incorporate``, then the dependency is
             optional, but the version of the target package is
             constrained.  See *Chapter 6* for a discussion of
             constraints and freezing.

           * If the value is ``require-any``, then any one of multiple target
             packages as specified by multiple ``fmri`` attributes can satisfy
             the dependency, following the same rules as the ``require``
             dependency type.

           * If the value is ``conditional``, the target is required
             only if the package defined by the ``predicate`` attribute is present
             on the system.

           * If the value is ``origin``, the target must, if present,
             be at the specified value or better on the image to be modified
             prior to installation.  If the value of the ``root-image`` attribute
             is ``true``, the target must be present on the image rooted at
             ‘``/``’ in order to install this package.

           * If the value is ``group``, the target is required unless the
             package is on the image avoid list.  Note that obsolete packages
             silently satisfy the ``group`` dependency.  See the ``avoid``
             subcommand in the |pkg| man page.

           * If the value is ``parent``, then the dependency is ignored if
             the image is not a child image, such as a zone.  If the image
             is a child image then the target is required to be present
             in the parent image.  The version matching for a ``parent``
             dependency is the same as that used for ``incorporate``
             dependencies.

     predicate
           The FMRI representing the predicate for ``conditional``
           dependencies.

     root-image
           Has an effect only for ``origin`` dependencies as mentioned above.

     An example of a ``depend`` action is::

         depend fmri=crypto/ca-certificates type=require


License Actions
```````````````

    The ``license`` action represents a license or other informational
    file associated with the package contents.  A package can deliver
    licenses, disclaimers, or other guidance to the package installer
    through the use of the license action.

    The payload of the license action is delivered into the image
    metadata directory related to the package, and should only contain
    human-readable text data.  It should not contain HTML or any
    other form of markup. Through attributes, license actions can
    indicate to clients that the related payload must be displayed
    and/or require acceptance of it.  The method of display and/or
    acceptance is at the discretion of clients.


    The following attributes are recognized:

    license
                    This attribute provides a meaningful description
                    for the license to assist users in determining
                    the contents without reading the license text
                    itself.  Some example values include:

                    * ABC Co. Copyright Notice
                    * ABC Co. Custom License
                    * Common Development and Distribution License 1.0 (CDDL)
                    * GNU General Public License 2.0 (GPL)
                    * GNU General Public License 2.0 (GPL) Only
                    * MIT License
                    * Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL)
                    * Simplified BSD License

                    Wherever possible, including the version of the
                    license in the description is recommended as shown
                    above. The license value must be unique within a package.
    must-accept
                    When ``true``, this license must be accepted by a
                    user before the related package can be installed
                    or updated.  Omission of this attribute is
                    equivalent to ``false``.  The method of
                    acceptance (interactive or configuration-based,
                    for example) is at the discretion of clients.

    must-display
                    When ``true``, the action's payload must be displayed
                    by clients during packaging operations.  Omission of
                    this value is considered equivalent to ``false``.
                    This attribute should not be used for copyright
                    notices, only actual licenses or other material
                    that must be displayed during operations.  The
                    method of display is at the discretion of
                    clients.

    The ``license`` attribute is the key attribute for the license action.

    An example of a ``license`` action is::

        license license="Apache v2.0"

Legacy Actions
``````````````

    The ``legacy`` action represents package data used by the legacy SVR4
    packaging system.  The attributes associated with this action are
    added into the legacy system’s databases so that the tools
    querying those databases can operate as if the legacy package were
    actually installed.  In particular, this should be sufficient to
    convince the legacy system that the package named by the ``pkg``
    attribute is installed on the system, so that the package can be used to
    satisfy SVR4 dependencies.

    The following attributes, named in accordance with the parameters in
    |pkginfo|, are recognized:

    category
              The value for the CATEGORY parameter.  The default value
              is ``system``.

    desc
              The value for the DESC parameter.

    hotline
              The value for the HOTLINE parameter.

    name
              The value for the NAME parameter.  The default value is
              ‘``none provided``’.

    pkg
              The abbreviation for the package being installed.  The
              default value is the name from the FMRI of the package.

    vendor
              The value for the VENDOR parameter.

    version
              The value for the VERSION parameter.  The default value is
              the version from the FMRI of the package.

    The ``pkg`` attribute is the key attribute for the legacy action.

    An example of a  ``legacy`` action is::

        legacy pkg=SUNWcsu arch=i386 category=system \
            desc="core software for a specific instruction-set architecture" \
            hotline="Please contact your local service provider" \
            name="Core Solaris, (Usr)" vendor="Oracle Corporation" \
            version=11.11,REV=2009.11.11 variant.arch=i386

Signature Actions
`````````````````
    Signature actions are used as part of the support for package signing in
    IPS.  They are covered in detail in *Chapter 11*.


User Actions
````````````

     The user action defines a UNIX user as defined in ``/etc/passwd``,
     ``/etc/shadow``, ``/etc/group``, and ``/etc/ftpd/ftpusers`` files.
     Users defined with this action have entries added to the
     appropriate files.

     The following attributes are recognized:

     username
                    The unique name of the user.

     password
                    The encrypted password of the user.  The default
                    value is ‘``*LK*``’.

     uid
                    The unique numeric ID of the user.  The default value
                    is the first free value under 100.

     group
                    The name of the user's primary group.  This must be
                    found in ``/etc/group``.

     gcos-field
                    The real name of the user, as represented in the GECOS
                    field in ``/etc/passwd``.  The default value is the
                    value of the ``username`` attribute.

     home-dir
                    The user's home directory.  The default value is
                    ‘``/``’.

     login-shell
                    The user's default shell.  The default value is
                    empty.

     group-list
                    Secondary groups to which the  user  belongs.
                    See ``group(4)``.

     ftpuser
                    Can be set to ``true`` or ``false``.  The default
                    value of ``true`` indicates that the user is
                    permitted to login via FTP. See ``ftpusers(4)``.

     lastchg
                    The number of days between January  1,  1970,
                    and the date that the password was last modified.
                    The default value is empty.

     min
                    The minimum number of days  required  between
                    password changes. This field must be set to 0
                    or above to enable  password  aging.  The default
                    value is empty.

     max
                    The maximum number of days  the  password  is
                    valid.  The default value is empty.  See ``shadow(4)``.

     warn
                    The number of days  before  password  expires
                    that the user is warned.

     inactive
                    The number of days of inactivity allowed  for
                    that  user.  This is counted on a per-machine
                    basis. The information about the  last  login
                    is taken from the machine's lastlog file.

     expire
                    An absolute date expressed as the  number  of
                    days  since the UNIX Epoch (January 1, 1970).
                    When this number is reached, the login can no
                    longer  be used. For example, an ``expire`` value
                    of 13514  specifies  a  login  expiration  of
                    January 1, 2007.

     flag
                    Set to empty.

     For more information on the values of these attributes, see
     the ``shadow(4)`` man page.

     A example of a user action is::

        user gcos-field="pkg(5) server UID" group=pkg5srv uid=97 username=pkg5srv


Group Actions
`````````````

     The  group  action  defines  a  UNIX  group  as  defined  in
     ``group(4)``.  No support is present for group passwords. Groups
     defined with this action initially have no user list.  Users
     can  be added with the user action. The following attributes
     are recognized:

     groupname
                  The value for the name of the group.

     gid
                  The group's unique numeric id.  The default
                  value is the first free group under 100.

     An example of a group action is::

         group groupname=pkg5srv gid=97

Repository
~~~~~~~~~~

A software repository contains packages for one or more publishers.
Repositories can be configured for access in a variety of different
ways: HTTP, HTTPS, file (on local storage or via NFS or SMB) and as a
self-contained package archive file, usually with the ``.p5p`` extension.

Package archives allow for convenient distribution of IPS packages,
and are discussed further in *Chapter 4*.

A repository accessed via HTTP or HTTPS has a server process (|pkg.depotd|)
associated with it; in the case of file repositories, the repository
software runs as part of the accessing client.

Repositories are created with the |pkgrepo| command, and package archives
are created with the |pkgrecv| command.
