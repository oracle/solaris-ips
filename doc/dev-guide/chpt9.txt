Causing System Change With SMF
..............................

This chapter explains how to use the Service Management Facility (SMF) to
automatically handle any necessary system changes that should occur as a result
of package installation.

The package developer must determine which actions, when initially installed,
updated or removed should cause a change to the system.  For each of those
actions, the package developer needs to determine which existing service
provides the desired system change, or write a new service which provides the
needed functionality and ensure that service is delivered to the system.

When the set of actions has been determined, those actions must be tagged in
the package manifest with the correct *actuator* in order to cause that system
change to occur.

As discussed in *Chapter 1*, some system changes are needed to employ the
*software self-assembly* concept used by Oracle Solaris and IPS, but system
changes are not limited to this role.

We'll discuss the available actuators in the next section and then provide some
examples.

Actuators
~~~~~~~~~

The following tags can be added to any action in a manifest:

reboot-needed
`````````````
This actuator takes the value ``true`` or ``false``. This actuator declares
that installation, removal or update of the tagged action requires a
reboot when IPS is operating on a live image.


The following actuators are related to SMF services, and are the ones we will
focus on in this chapter.

SMF Actuators
`````````````
SMF actuators take a single SMF FMRI as a value, possibly including globbing
characters to match multiple FMRIs.  If the same FMRI is tagged by multiple
actions, possibly across multiple packages being operated on, IPS will only
trigger that actuator once.

The following list of SMF actuators describes the effect on the service FMRI
that is the value of each named actuator:

  disable_fmri
         The given service should be disabled prior to the package operation
         being performed

  refresh_fmri
         The given service should be refreshed after the package operation has
         completed

  restart_fmri
         The given service should be restarted after the package operation has
         completed

  suspend_fmri
         The given service should be temporarily suspended prior to the package
         operation and enabled once it has completed


Delivering an SMF Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A package that delivers a new SMF service usually needs a system change.  The
package delivers the SMF manifest file and method script, and the packaged
application requires that the SMF service it delivers must be available
after package installation.

In older Oracle Solaris releases, SVR4 post-install scripting would run an SMF
command to restart the ``svc:/system/manifest-import:default`` service.

In IPS, the action delivering the manifest file into ``lib/svc/manifest`` or
``var/svc/manifest`` should instead be tagged with the actuator:
``restart_fmri=svc:/system/manifest-import:default``.

The actuator ensures that when the manifest is added, updated, or removed, the
``manifest-import`` service is restarted, causing the service delivered by that
SMF manifest to be added, updated, or removed.

If the package is added to a live-system, this action is performed once all
packages have been added to the system during that packaging operation.  If the
package is added to an alternate boot environment, this action is performed
during the first boot of that boot environment.

A Service That Runs Once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another common example is a system change that performs one-time configuration
of the new software environment.

In the package delivering our application, we would include the following
actions::

    file path=opt/myapplication/bin/run-once.sh owner=root group=sys mode=0755
    file path=lib/svc/manifest/application/myapplication-run-once.xml owner=root group=sys \
        mode=0644 restart_fmri=svc:/system/manifest-import:default

The SMF method script for the service could contain anything that is needed to
further configure our application, or modify the system so that our application
runs efficiently.  In this example, we'll just have it write a simple log
message.

Generally, we also want to ensure that the SMF service only performs work if the
application has not already been configured.
Another approach would be to package the service separate from the application
itself, then have the method script remove the package that contains the
service.

Our method script is::

    #!/usr/bin/sh
    . /lib/svc/share/smf_include.sh
    assembled=$(/usr/bin/svcprop -p config/assembled $SMF_FMRI)
    if [ "$assembled" == "true" ] ; then
        exit $SMF_EXIT_OK
    fi
    svccfg -s $SMF_FMRI setprop config/assembled = true
    svccfg -s $SMF_FMRI refresh
    echo "This is output from our run-once method script"

When testing a method script, it is advisable to run ``pkg verify``
before and after installing the package that runs the actuator.
Compare the output of each run to ensure that the script doesn't attempt to
modify any files that are not marked as editable.

Our SMF service manifest is::

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE service_bundle SYSTEM "/usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/service_bundle.dtd.1">

    <service_bundle type='manifest' name='MyApplication:run-once'>

    <service
        name='application/myapplication/run-once'
        type='service'
        version='1'>

        <single_instance />

        <dependency
            name='fs-local'
            grouping='require_all'
            restart_on='none'
            type='service'>
                <service_fmri value='svc:/system/filesystem/local:default' />
        </dependency>

        <dependent
                name='myapplication_self-assembly-complete'
                grouping='optional_all'
                restart_on='none'>
                <service_fmri value='svc:/milestone/self-assembly-complete' />
        </dependent>
        <instance enabled='true' name='default'>
                <exec_method
                    type='method'
                    name='start'
                    exec='/opt/myapplication/bin/run-once.sh'
                    timeout_seconds='0'/>

                <exec_method
                    type='method'
                    name='stop'
                    exec=':true'
                    timeout_seconds='0'/>

                <property_group name='startd' type='framework'>
                    <propval name='duration' type='astring' value='transient' />
                </property_group>

                <property_group name='config' type='application'>
                    <propval name='assembled' type='boolean' value='false' />
                </property_group>
        </instance>
    </service>
    </service_bundle>


Note that the SMF service has a ``startd/duration`` property set to
``transient`` so that |svc.startd| doesn't track processes for this service.
Also note that it adds itself as a dependency to the ``self-assembly-complete``
system milestone.



Self-Assembly Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some additional hints when writing SMF methods to support
self-assembly:

Timestamps
``````````
In an SMF method script, it can be efficient to use the output of ``ls -t`` on a
directory of packaged configuration file fragments, using ``head -1`` to select
the most recently changed version.  The timestamp of this file can be compared
with the timestamp of the unpackaged configuration file which is compiled from
those fragments.  This comparison can be used when deciding whether the service
needs to recompile the configuration file.

This can be useful if the process of compiling a configuration file from those
fragments is expensive to perform each time the method script runs.

Timeouts
````````
In the example SMF service used in this chapter, we had a ``timeout_seconds``
value of ``0`` for the start method.  This means that SMF will wait indefinitely
for self-assembly to complete.

Depending on circumstances, developers might want to impose a finite timeout on
their self-assembly processes, enabling SMF to drop the service to
``maintenance`` if something goes wrong.  This can assist the developer when
debugging.
